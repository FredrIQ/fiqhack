NetHack 4
=========

NetHack 4 is a version of the computer game NetHack, that aims to bring a
better-quality codebase and a less hostile interface to NetHack's highly rated
"roguelike" gameplay.  Unlike many NetHack variants, it is intentionally
conservative in making gameplay changes; in particular, it avoids to aim the
common problem whereby development is driven via fixing perceived balance
issues with the game (often losing the ability to improvise solutions to
complex problems in the process), or via focusing too much on the difference
between wins and losses (meaning that players are forced into taking the best
choice, rather than the choice they enjoy most or a choice they want to try).
See the file `doc/philosophy.txt` for more information on NetHack 4's
philosophy.

NetHack 4 was originally produced by merging two forks, Alex Smith's AceHack,
and Daniel Thaler's NitroHack.  Since then it has incorporated changes from
numerous other forks (especially the fertile sources of bugfixes that are
GruntHack and UnNetHack), and has had many improvements of its own.

NetHack 4 has come a long way in the 3 years since 2009, when AceHack began.
Out of all the lines of C, lex, and yacc source code currently in NetHack 4,
less than half (approximately 46%) originally come from NetHack 3.4.3 or
earlier – even if you don't count whitespace changes.  The rest are typically
modifications or even rewrites of the old code with bugs fixed and style
improved.  Many people have suggested rewriting NetHack from scratch to get
rid of the bugs and improve the coding style, but doing so would be close to
an impossible project.  Our continuous changes of NetHack from the inside will
eventually accomplish a similar goal, but in a more realistic manner.

This README file describes NetHack 4.3, which focuses mostly on improvements
to the game's internals, rather than gameplay changes.  We are planning to
make more substantial gameplay changes in 4.4.

Bugs in NetHack 4 can be reported at http://trac.nethack4.org, our bug
tracker.  The homepage for NetHack 4 itself is http://nethack4.org, and
contains many other resources about the game and its community.

You can discuss NetHack 4 on IRC. irc:irc.freenode.net/nethack4 is the
specific channel for NetHack 4, and typically discusses development.  For
gameplay advice, the best place is the general NetHack discussion channel at
irc:irc.freenode.net/nethack (which also covers NetHack 3 and Slash'EM).  If
you're more old-fashioned, you can use Usenet instead; the appropriate
newsgroup is rec.games.roguelike.nethack (although they would appreciate it if
you put `[NetHack 4]` in the subject line to make it clear that you aren't
talking about NetHack 3).

If you want to contact the developers directly, you can use IRC, or email;

Selected Changes
================

For a full list of changes in NetHack 4 compared to the NetHack 3 series, see
`doc/changelog.txt`.  Some of the most interesting or noticeable changes are
listed below.

  * Numerous bugfixes.  Over 150 of the numbered bugs in NetHack 3.4.3 have
    been fixed *intentionally*; many more have been fixed as a side effect of
    the improvements to NetHack's internals included in NetHack 4, and many
    bugs have been fixed in NetHack 4 that aren't included in the NetHack
    3.4.3 bug list (because the NetHack 3 devteam failed to add them, despite
    being notified about them).

  * A fully rewritten interface, that nonetheless is almost compatible at the
    keystroke level with 3.4.3 (with a few exceptions to reduce the effect of
    making typos, or to remove redundant prompts).  Just like previous
    versions, both tiles and console ports are available; unlike previous
    versions, these ports are keystroke-compatible with each other, so
    more detailed graphics no longer have to be accompanied by a loss in
    functionality on the keyboard.
    
    Features of the interface include:

      * Status lines which visually represent health and magical power, and
        which use color in order to draw attention to dangerous situations and
        to allow a quick appraisal of the character out of the corner of your
        eye – but stay gray if they have nothing urgent to say, so that they
        are most visible when most necessary.
        
      * Improved support for large terminals:
      
          * Extra vertical space will be used to display more messages at once
            (cutting down on the need to space through messages at the
            infamous `--More--` prompt, and to present more information in the
            status area.  If you have even more vertical space than that, the
            spare space will be used for mouselook (showing information about
            the map square the mouse is pointing over), and for reminders
            about the controls.  (New players are recommended to use very
            vertically large terminals.)
        
          * If you have spare horizontal space, it is used to maintain a
            permanent display of the inventory and to show information about
            the floor beneath your character's feet.

      * More information shown on the game map.  You can see where your
        character's been walking, see stairs and traps underneath items, and
        tell at a glance which monsters are peaceful.

      * Better rendering for map characters.  NetHack 3.4.3 could only use
        IBMgraphics or DECgraphics for this, often with neither working
        without spending time configuring your terminal.  NetHack 4 will
        automatically switch between IBMgraphics and Unicode according to the
        needs of your terminal, meaning that there is rarely a need to change
        settings.

      * Commands are now fully rebindable.  In most cases, though, you won't
        need to; unlike NetHack 3, NetHack 4 understands most of the keys on
        the keyboard, meaning that (especially with NumLock off) it can
        distinguish the main keyboard and numeric keypad numbers, meaning that
        there's no longer a need to mess around with the `numpad` option.  In
        fact, you can even use the cursor keys for navigation (without losing
        the ability to use diagonals), giving three styles of movement:
        
                  vi-keys           cursor keys         number keys
                  y  k  u         Home  Up   PgUp         7  8  9
                  h  .  l         Left  .   Right         4  .  6
                  b  j  n         End  Down  PgDn         1  2  3

        (This sadly cuts slightly into the convenience commands that numpad
        players were used to.  Instead of `N` for `#name`, you can use `C`;
        instead of `k` for kicking, you can use `^D`.  For command repeat,
        just use the numbers on the main keyboard.)
        
        Another gain from this is that the `Meta-` shortcuts for many extended
        commands, that do not work properly in 3.4.3 on many terminals, will
        normally work in NetHack 4 (using the `Alt` key on the keyboard).

      * Addition of some new, convenient, commands, without compromising the
        original commands:
        
          * You can limit any command to a specific number of actions via
            specifying a number of actions to stop after.  (Single-turn
            commands will be repeated for that many actions instead, as in
            3.4.3.)

          * `^A` is a lot more powerful; when repeating commands, it will
            remember what choices you made, and if you use it after an
            interrupted multi-turn command, it will resume that command for
            you.

          * You no longer have to remember the difference between `W` and `P`,
            or between `R` and `T`; they're interchangeable now.  In fact, you
            no longer have to remember any of those commands, nor `w`, `x`, or
            `Q`, because you can now change your equipment around using `A`.
            Also, your character will temporarily unequip armor in order to
            manipulate armor beneath it, meaning that you don't have to
            explicitly remove a suit in order to take off a shirt.

          * There's no need to explicitly open doors any more; just use the
            direction keys to walk towards them.  If they turn out to be
            locked, you can now unlock them with `o`.

          * If you find exploring empty areas tedious, you can let the game
            take over for you; press `v`, and an AI will take over the
            exploring for you until it finds something interesting or a
            monster turns up.

          * The game will remember information about other levels for you,
            accessible via the `^O` command; not only will it give a quick
            guide to interesting features on each level, but you can select a
            level from the menu to view what you remember about its map.

          * Fed up of typing out Elbereth by hand?  The `^E` command is a
            quick shortcut to write an Elbereth in the dust.

      * It's now harder to do things that are normally bad ideas by mistake –
        but it's still possible to do them intentionally.  For instance,
        moving towards a shopkeeper is interpreted as "pay" (`p`) rather than
        "fight" (`F`); you'd need to give the `F` intentionally if you wanted
        to attack.  Likewise, moving into lava (when not levitating, confused,
        or the like) needs an `m` prefix, or the game will give a warning and
        your character will wisely just stand there.

      * Along similar lines, you now normally use `,` as an inventory letter
        to interact with items on the floor (e.g. `e,` to eat them), because
        the ambiguity of `ey` lead to many typo-related deaths back in 3.4.3.

      * The game now tracks more information about your character, with a
        "history" view that shows major events in your character's life, and
        with dumplogs produced when the game ends to summarize the heroic
        efforts and final defeat (or glorious victory) of your character.

  * Customizing options no longer requires messing around with configuration
    files; you can change options for one game using the in-game `O` command,
    and options for all future games from the main menu.  There are numerous
    improvements to the options themselves, too:
    
      * You can set various "birth options" for your game in order to control
        what sort of game you want to play, ranging from something small like
        turning off bones, to challenge modes where your character is
        permanently blind or hallucinating.  There's no longer a need to
        recompile the game if you want to do something like turn off Elbereth.
        
      * Autopickup is a lot more customizable than in 3.4.3, with the ability
        to add rules that match various properties of items against patterns
        to choose whether to pick them up.

      * There are many more options for what the main movement keys do.  In
        3.4.3, your choices are limited to choosing whether they displace pets
        and whether they ask for confirmation when you attack peacefuls.  In
        NetHack 4, you could for instance have them refuse to attack monsters
        altogether, without losing the ability to pick up items (which is what
        adding an `m` before every comand would do).

      * Finally, if you're a traditionalist, don't worry: the vast majority of
        the new interface features from NetHack 4 can be turned off, leaving
        you with an uninteresting 3.4.3-like ASCII view if you want.

  * The save system has been rewritten (and we removed all the much-maligned
    NitroHack save code, too).  Save files now contain a complete history of
    the gamestate, allowing them to be reconstructed at any point, making it
    possible to view a replay of a game with full character knowledge.  The
    save files are also saved continuously; if something goes wrong, whether
    it's a bug in the game or your terminal crashing, you'll be able to just
    pick back up where you left.  You can even save in the middle of a turn!
    The game is also ever-vigilant for mistakes in the save system; if at any
    point your game can no longer be restored from its save, it will stop
    gameplay immediately, maximizing the chances that the save file can be
    recovered, rather than letting you play on and then losing all your
    progress since the moment it went wrong.

  * There have been some gameplay changes, mostly to remove "difficulty" that
    was created via relying on a bad interface and entirely avoidable via
    playing slowly and taking lots of notes.  Most notably, floating eyes can
    no longer be hit in melee unless you have protection from their gaze,
    meaning that you'll never hit them by mistake, but you'll never be able to
    hit them on purpose either.  Likewise, amnesia does not cause the
    character to forget anything the player could have made out-of-game notes
    about, but rather drains skill points and spells.
    
    There are also many changes to streamline the interface.  Try dropping a
    container full of unidentified items on an altar some time.
    
    Finally, there are some improvements in the monster AI.  For instance,
    pets can use their special attacks now, and hostile monsters may attack
    each other even without conflict if they dislike each other enough.

  * The game now supports server play, in which the interface and game engine
    can be on different physical machines, communicating using JSON over a
    network.  See `doc/server_protocol.txt` for the technical details.

  * Building the game from source is much easier than it was in NetHack
    3.4.3.  See the build instructions below.


Build Instructions
==================

UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X
-------------------

You will need to install NetHack 4's dependencies: zlib (which is probably
installed already, but you may need to get its development headers from your
package manager), and (if you want a working server binary) postgresql and
pgcrypto.  You also need development headers for those libraries.

NetHack 4 also requires a working libjansson library (available from
http://www.digip.org/jansson), and its development headers.  However, both of
those ship with NetHack 4; to use those copies, you can give `--with=jansson`
as an option to `aimake`.  (Leaving that option absent, or giving
`--without=jansson`, means you will have to install libjansson by yourself.)

If you want to build the tiles or faketerm ports (the default), you will also
need to install version 2 of the Simple DirectMedia Layer; it may be available
in your package manager, or else you could download the source code from
http://www.libsdl.org and compile it yourself.  Otherwise, you can specify
`--without=gui` as an option to `aimake` to build just the console port (which
is built either way), and disable the tiles ports.  Note that the tiles ports
do not currently work on Mac OS X.

Assuming you just want to run NetHack 4 from your home directory, from the top
source directory, run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../aimake -i ~/nethack4 .. # or wherever you want

If you want to install for all users, you will need to tell `aimake` which
location to install it into, and how to elevate its permissions:

    # as a regular user, not root
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../aimake -i /usr/local -S su ..    # or perhaps -S sudo

Note that this requires a group `games` to exist on your system, and contain
no normal users, in order to ensure security of the bones files and high score
tables.  This is the case on most Linux distributions, but not on all
(e.g. Gentoo), and may not be the case on UNIX.

To run the console port, use `nethack4`.  For the tiles/faketerm ports, use
`nethack4-sdl`.

If you want to run your own server (which is only necessary/useful if you want
people to be able to connect to your NetHack 4 server from other computers,
rather than running locally), you'll need to give `--with=server` as a
command-line option to `aimake`, and also need to set up the postgresql
database:

    su postgres             # or any other way to elevate your permissions
    createuser -DPRS nh4server
    # You'll be prompted for a password at this point.
    createdb -O nh4server nethack4
    echo 'CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto' | psql -d nethack4
    exit                    # go back to your normal permissions

Next you need to edit the configuration file (a blank configuration file will
have been installed in the appropriate place for you to edit).  If you
installed into `~/nethack4`, it should be named
`~/nethack4/config/nethack4.conf`; other forms of install may have other
locations.  (You can run nethack4-server with no arguments to discover where
the configuration file should be; if it can't find its configuration file,
it'll complain and tell you where it's looking for it.)

The configuration file looks something like this:

    dbhost=127.0.0.1
    dbport=5432
    dbuser=nh4server
    dbpass=**password**
    dbname=nethack4

Note that the port number has been known to vary based on the way that your
copy of postgresql is packaged; you may want to verify it by looking at
postgresql's configuration, `/etc/postgresql/.../postgresql.conf`.  Also be
aware that the configuration file necessarily has to store the password in
plaintext (a hashed password is no good for actually logging into the
database); you may want to change the permissions on the configuration file to
help protect it.  (I recommend using a long random password, because it's only
used by computers; there's no need for humans to memorize it.)

Now you can just run the `nethack4-server` binary to start the server; it will
daemonize itself.  To test your server setup, you can use the `nethack4`
client; there's a menu option to connect to a server with it.

The easiest way to stop the `nethack4-server` binary is to run
`nethack4-server -k`, which will automatically work out which process is the
server from its pidfile, and tell it to stop.


Windows
-------

You will need to install various prerequisite programs in order to compile
NetHack 4.  The build system is written in Perl, and as such, the simplest way
to get a working toolchain is to install Strawberry Perl, available at
http://strawberryperl.com, which comes with a working C toolchain.  You will
also need to install Flex and Bison, scanner and parser generators; the
versions at GnuWin32 (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) work (although they
don't have a very Windows-like idea of directory structure, and thus can't be
installed to paths with spaces in).  Strawberry Perl's and GnuWin32's
executables will all need to be on your PATH (search for "PATH" in Control
Panel, on recent versions of Windows).

You will also need to create two more folders, `build` and `install`; I
recommend that both are parallel to the `nethack4` folder that contains the
entire NetHack 4 distribution.

If you want to build a tiles or fake terminal port (recommended even if you
aren't a tiles player, because Windows' terminal is rather slow), you will
need version 2 of the Simple DirectMedia Layer.  Download the MinGW version of
the development headers and import libraries from http://www.libsdl.org; also
download the library itself.  Then copy the entire `include/SDL2` subdirectory
from the appropriate processor-dependent directory of the SDL distribution, to
the `c/include` folder that was created when you installed Strawberry Perl (so
that it beomes `c/include/SDL`); and all the files `lib/*.a` from the
appropriate processor-dependent directory of the SDL distribution to the
`c/lib` folder that was created when you installed Strawberry Perl (so that
they become `c/lib/libSDL2.a`, etc.).  Finally, copy the file `SDL2.dll` that
you obtained when you downloaded the library itself to the `install` folder
you just created.

Once you've done this, open a command prompt, change to the build directory,
and type:

    perl ../nethack4/aimake -i ../install --with=jansson --directory-layout=single_directory

aimake should compile and install the entirety of NetHack 4 for you into the
install directory.  In order to run the console port, change directory to the
install directory, and type `nethack4`.  For the tiles/faketerm port, use
`nethack4-sdl.exe`.

Note that despite the best efforts of the rendering library, the game is quite
slow to render on the console recent versions of Windows; this is because the
Windows console itself is prety slow.  (For a comparison, you can try running
a command that produces a lot of text, such as `perl ../nethack4/aimake
--documentation`, and observing how long it takes to scroll the screen when
you press the spacebar.)  The faketerm port somehow manages to be faster, even
though it too is fairly slow.
