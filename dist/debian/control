Description: modernized version of the classic roguelike
 NetHack 4 is a modernized version of the classic game NetHack. It adds a
 completely new user interface, numerous bugfixes, and much more. It also tries
 to avoid killing the player with the interface - its authors feel that player
 deaths should be the result of their actions, not their typos.
 .
 NetHack itself is perhaps the best-known "roguelike" game: a screen-oriented
 dungeon crawler in which levels are randomly generated, giving a different
 gameplay experience each time. NetHack's emphasis is on developing your
 character in the way you want; if it feels like something should be possible,
 it probably is. The eventual goal of the game is to collect the Amulet of
 Yendor from deep in the dungeon, but concentrating on learning to survive in
 the dungeon should be most players' first priority; winning the game can take
 months of learning, as when a character dies, you have to restart the game from
 scratch.
 .
 This package contains the files required both to play in a terminal, and to
 play in a separate window with optional graphical tile support.
