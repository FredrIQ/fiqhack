Changes in 4.3.0.0:
-------------------

 * Mitre of Holiness has been buffed, it now allows you to pray or
   turn undead within Gehennom

 * Turn undead (the knight/priest ability) helplessness now depends on
   your experience level

 * Wands has been rebalanced. Each player now have a wand skill that
   is exercised by zapping wands. This skill affects the power of a
   wand zap. Apart from barbarians, who are restricted, everyone can
   get at least basic in this new skill. Zapping a cursed wand counts
   as a skill level less than your usual one and zapping a blessed one
   counts as a skill level more. Zapping a cursed wand at unskilled
   causes an explosion, even if you zap it by engraving with it. Rays
   from at least skilled wand usage generally ignores reflection

 * Intrinsics and extrinsics now work the same for monsters and
   players. This entails the following.
   + Petrification, sliming and sickness are now gradual processes for
     monsters, and some other temporary properties (invisibility,
     speed) can time out
   + Monsters can now be very fast, have polymorphitis, aggravate
     monster, be displaced, etc...
   + Players can now be cancelled, which prevents using any skill that
     requires usage of energy. Curable with gain energy, confused
     charging or stepping on magic traps
   + Player monsters get intrinsics as they level up
   + Eating corpses or jewelry now confers intrinsics for monsters

 * Added shimmering dragons, along with the baby

 * Being slow is now a temporary intrinsic and can now affect players
   as well. There is no cure, but it wears off with time.

 * Added 4 new level 7 spells
   + Spellbook of phase -- gives intrinsic phasing for a while
   + Spellbook of charging -- allow you to "uncursed"-charge objects
   + Spellbook of astral eyesight -- gives temporary X-Ray vision
   + Spellbook of summon nasty -- summons one or more "nasty" monsters

 * Monsters now cast from the player list of spells
   + Includes all spells that they could possibly make use of
   + They can read books to learn new spells
   + Monster have no spell memory, if they know a spell they will
     never forget it

 * Improved the monster AI when it come to using items
   + They now use almost every wand, scroll, potion, spell
   + They will now try to avoid friendly fire unless they know that
     the spell/etc is resisted
   + They can use bags now (containers and tricks)
   + They now have a concept of knowing BUC and/or enchantment on an
     item and will use them accordingly. As a result, removed some
     cases of monsters cheating but also made them use certain items
     differently depending on BUC. For example, a monster now needs
     to zap a wand at :0 to discover that it is :0, but it can also
     know to only use cursed gain level as an escape tool
   + They can now wish for items. Yes, including with a wand of
     wishing, but also from smoky potions
   + They now use keys/etc and wands of opening/knock spell to unlock
     doors, and possibly to unlock chests and loot them (They will
     not loot the castle wand)

 * Several bug fixes, both for vanilla bugs and some NetHack4 ones

 * Tweaked Ranger quest levels
   + Added Khor's ranger quest home
   + Added Chris_ANG's ranger quest goal

 * Bones are more interesting -- 33% of the time if you would leave
   a corpse on death, you are revived and charmed by the Wizard, and
   are thus a force to be reckoned with by those who find your bones.
   However, as a trade off, if this happens, your items wont be cursed
   (Synergy with monsters using bags is by design). Your ghost --
   undead turned or not -- will also retain all your intrinsics, IN
   ADDITION to the perks of being a ghost

 * Monsters now have proficiencies
   + Unlike players, these are static per-monster-type
   + Monsters only have proficiency in wands and spell schools

 * Player monsters who acquire the Amulet turns all their focus on
   ascending the game. In the event that they succeed, you lose
   (counted as an escape)

 * Monsters now wear rings, and wear most amulets now

 * Player monsters can now spawn very rarely in the dungeon

 * Player monsters' ascension kit on Astral Plane has been buffed
