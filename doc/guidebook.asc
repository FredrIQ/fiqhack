== Introduction ==

Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant 
in your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting, stealing, 
crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months, 
but you aren't sure of the reason.  You wonder whether you have in 
fact been having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to 
forget about them until now.

Some nights you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid
recollection of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be
lurking behind every corner of the dungeon in your dream.  Could these
details haunting your dreams be real?  As each night passes, you feel
the desire to enter the mysterious caverns near the ruins grow
stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly put the idea out of your
head as you recall the tales of those who entered the caverns before
you and did not return.

Eventually you can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place
in your dreams no longer.  After all, when other adventurers came back
this way after spending time in the caverns, they usually seemed
better off than when they passed through the first time.  And who was
to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept going?

Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of Yendor by some,
which, if you can find it, will bring you great wealth.  One legend you were
told even mentioned that the one who finds the amulet will be granted
immortality by the gods.  The amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the
Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of Menace.

Upon hearing the legends, you immediately realize that there is some
profound and undiscovered reason that you are to descend into the
caverns and seek out that amulet of which they spoke.  Even if the
rumors of the amulet's powers are untrue, you decide that you should
at least be able to sell the tales of your adventures to the local
minstrels for a tidy sum, especially if you encounter any of the
terrifying and magical creatures of your dreams along the way.

You spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local inn,
becoming more and more depressed as you watch the odds of your success
being posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.

In the morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set off for the
dungeon.  After several days of uneventful travel, you see the ancient
ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace.  It is late at
night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the night sleeping
under the open skies.  In the morning, you gather your gear, eat what
may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon...

== What is going on here? ==

You have just begun a game of 'NetHack'.  Your goal is to grab as much
treasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the
Mazes of Menace alive.  

Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of adventure
will vary with your background and training:

*Archeologists*::
	understand dungeons pretty well; this enables them
	to move quickly and sneak up on the local nasties.  They start equipped
	with the tools for a proper scientific expedition.

*Barbarians*::
	are warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to battle.  They
	begin their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a trusty
	hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.

*Cavemen* and *Cavewomen*::
	start with exceptional strength, but unfortunately, neolithic
	weapons.

*Healers*::
	are wise in medicine and apothecary.  They know the herbs and
	simples that can restore vitality, ease pain, anesthetize, and
	neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they can
	divine a being's state of health or sickness.  Their medical
	practice earns them quite reasonable amounts of money, with
	which they enter the dungeon.

*Knights*::
	are distinguished from the common skirmisher by their devotion
	to the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing excellence of
	their armor.

*Monks*::
	are ascetics, who by rigorous practice of physical and mental
	disciplines have become capable of fighting as effectively
	without weapons as with.  They wear no armor but make up for
	it with increased mobility.

*Priests* and *Priestesses*::
	are clerics militant, crusaders advancing the cause of
	righteousness with arms, armor, and arts thaumaturgic.
	Their ability to commune with deities via prayer
	occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put
	them in it.

*Rangers*::
	are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly out of
	place in a dungeon.  They are, however, experts in archery as
	well as tracking and stealthy movement.

*Rogues*::
	are agile and stealthy thieves, with knowledge of locks,
	traps, and poisons.  Their advantage lies in surprise, which
	they employ to great advantage.

*Samurai*::
	are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.  They are lightly
	armored and quick, and wear the 'dai-sho', two swords of the
	deadliest keenness.

*Tourists*::
	start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping with), a
	credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera.
	Most monsters don't like being photographed.

*Valkyries*::
	are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in the harsh
	Northlands makes them strong, inures them to extremes of cold,
	and instills in them stealth and cunning.

*Wizards*::
	start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of magical
	items, and a particular affinity for dweomercraft.  Although
	seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an
	experienced Wizard is a deadly foe.

You may also choose the race of your character:

*Dwarves*::
	are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and solid
	individuals.  Dwarves' most notable trait is their great
	expertise in mining and metalwork.  Dwarvish armor is said to
	be second in quality not even to the mithril armor of the
	Elves.

*Elves*::
	are agile, quick, and perceptive; very little of what goes on
	will escape an Elf.  The quality of Elven craftsmanship often
	gives them an advantage in arms and armor.

*Gnomes*::
	are smaller than but generally similar to dwarves.  Gnomes are
	known to be expert miners, and it is known that a secret
	underground mine complex built by this race exists within the
	Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.

*Humans*::
	are by far the most common race of the surface world, and are
	thus the norm by which other races are often compared.
	Although they have no special abilities, they can succeed in
	any role.

*Orcs*::
	are a cruel and barbaric race that hate every living thing
	(including other orcs).  Above all others, Orcs hate Elves
	with a passion unequalled, and will go out of their way to
	kill one at any opportunity.  The armor and weapons fashioned
	by the Orcs are typically of inferior quality.

== What do all those things on the screen mean? ==

On the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what you have 
seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the level, 
it appears on the screen in front of you.

When NetHack's ancestor 'rogue' first appeared, its screen
orientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games.  Since
then, screen orientation has become the norm rather than the
exception; NetHack continues this fine tradition.  Unlike text
adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sentences and
explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all one or two
keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.  A
minimum screen size of 24 lines by 80 columns is recommended; if the
screen is larger, only a 21x80 section will be used for the map.

NetHack can even be played by blind players, with the assistance of
Braille readers or speech synthesizers.  Instructions for configuring
NetHack for the blind are included later in this document.

NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even the
authors still find it an entertaining and exciting game despite
having won several times.

There are three possible display options: a monochrome character
interface using plain ASCII, a color character interface using
Unicode, and a graphical interface using small pictures called tiles.
There is no difference between the various display options
with respect to game play.  

Because we cannot reproduce the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and
because it is common to all ports, we will use the default ASCII
characters from the monochrome character display when referring to
things you might see on the screen during your game.  In order to
understand what is going on in NetHack, first you must understand what
NetHack is doing with the screen.  The NetHack screen replaces the
``You see '' descriptions of text adventure games.

Figure 1 is a sample of what a NetHack screen might look like.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== The status ===

The two lines of the screen below the map contain several cryptic
pieces of information describing your current status.  If either
status line becomes longer than the width of the screen, you might not
see all of it.  Here are explanations of what the various status items
mean (though your configuration may not have all the status items
listed below):

*Rank*::
	Your character's name and professional ranking (based on the
	experience level, see below).

*Strength*::
	A measure of your character's strength; one of your six basic
	attributes.  A human character's attributes can range from 3
	to 18 inclusive; non-humans may exceed these limits
	(occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx,
	and magic can also cause attributes to exceed the normal
	limits).  The higher your strength, the stronger you are.
	Strength affects how successfully you perform physical tasks,
	how much damage you do in combat, and how much loot you can
	carry.

*Dexterity*::
	Dexterity affects your chances to hit in combat, to avoid
	traps, and do other tasks requiring agility or manipulation of
	objects.

*Constitution*::
	Constitution affects your ability to recover from injuries and
	other strains on your stamina.

*Intelligence*::
	Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells and read spellbooks.

*Wisdom*::
	Wisdom comes from your practical experience (especially when
	dealing with magic).  It affects your magical energy.

*Charisma*::
	Charisma affects how certain creatures react toward you.  In
	particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.

*Alignment*::
	'Lawful', 'Neutral' or 'Chaotic'.  Often, Lawful is taken as
	good and Chaotic is evil, but legal and ethical do not always
	coincide.  Your alignment influences how other monsters react
	toward you.  Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to
	be non-aggressive, while those of an opposing alignment are
	more like ly to be seriously offended at your presence.

*Dungeon Level*::
	How deep you are in the dungeon.  You start at level one and
	the number increases as you go deeper into the dungeon.  Some
	levels are special, and are identified by a name and not a
	number.  The Amulet of Yendor is reputed to be somewhere
	beneath the twentieth level.

*Gold*::
	The number of gold pieces you are openly carrying.  Gold which
	you have concealed in containers is not counted.

*Hit Points*::
        Your current and maximum hit points.  Hit points indicate how
     	much damage you can take before you die.  The more you get hit
     	in a fight, the lower they get.  You can regain hit points by
     	resting, or by using certain magical items or spells.  The
     	number in parentheses is the maximum number your hit points
     	can reach.

*Power*::
	Spell points.  This tells you how much mystic energy ('mana')
	you have available for spell casting.  Again, resting will
	regenerate the amount available.

*Defence*::
        A measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from unfriendly
        creatures.  The higher this number is, the more effective the armor; it

*Experience*:: 
	Your current experience level and experience points.  As you
	adventure, you gain experience points.  At certain experience
	point totals, you gain an experience level.  The more
	experienced you are, the better you fight and withstand
	magical attacks.  Many dungeons show only your experience
	level here.

*Time*::
	The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have the
	'time' option set.

*Hunger Status*::
	Your current hunger status, ranging from 'Satiated' down to
	'Fainting'.  If your hunger status is normal, it is not
	displayed.  Additional status flags may appear after the
	hunger status: 'Conf' when you're confused, 'FoodPois' or
	'Ill' when sick, 'Blind' when you can't see, 'Stun' when
	stunned, and 'Hallu' when hallucinating.

=== The message area ===

The top window on the screen is reserved for messages that describe
things that are impossible to represent visually.  If you see a
+--More--+ on the top line, this means that NetHack has another
message to display on the screen, but it wants to make certain that
you've read the one that is there first.  To read the next message,
just press the space bar. To read the message history, use +^P+.

=== The map  ===

The upper left side of the screen is the map of the level as you have
explored it so far.  Each symbol on the screen represents something.
You can set various graphics options to change some of the symbols the
game uses; otherwise, the game will use default symbols.  Here is a
list of what the default symbols mean:

+-+ and +|+::
    The walls of a room, or an open door.  Or a grave (+|+).  It is
    likely that your wall symbols will be box characters.

+.+::
    The floor of a room, ice, or a doorless doorway. Floor squares you
    have walked on will probably be a different color.

+#+::
    A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen sink
    or a drawbridge.

+>+::
    Stairs down: a way to the next level.  An underlined stair is
    ``long'', leading to a dungeon branch.

+<+::
    Stairs up: a way to the previous level. An underlined stair is
    ``long'', leading up out of a dungeon branch (or on level 1,
    out of the dungeon).

+++::
    A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell you may be able to learn.

+@+::
    Your character or a human.

+$+::
     A pile of gold.

+^+::
     A trap (once you have detected it).

+)+::
    A weapon.

+[+::
    A suit or piece of armor.

+%+::
    Something edible (not necessarily healthy).

+?+::
    A scroll.

+/+::
    A wand.

+=+::
    A ring.

+!+::
    A potion.

+(+::
    A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp \ldots).

+"+::
    An amulet or a spider web.

+*+::
    A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).

+`+::
    A statue.

+0+::
    A boulder or iron ball.

+_+::
    An altar, or an iron chain.

+{+::
    A fountain.

+}+::
    A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.

+\\+::
    An opulent throne.

+~+::
    Tail segment of a long worm.

12345::
    Unidentified monsters shown by the Warning ability.  Number is
    proportional to the monster's tougness.

+a-zA-Z@\'&;:]+
    Letters and certain other symbols represent the various
    inhabitants of the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out, they can be nasty
    and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can be helpful.

+I+::
    This marks the last known location of an invisible or otherwise
    unseen monster.  Note that the monster could have moved.  The ``F''
    and ``m'' commands may be useful here.

You need not memorize all these symbols; you can ask the game what any
symbol represents with the +/+ command (see the next section for
more info).

=== Inventory ===

If your virtual terminal is wide enough (102 characters minimum) you
will see a second window on the right hand side listing the inventory 
of items and treasure you are carrying.  Various popup menus will
appear here so as not to obscure your map view.

=== Selection menus ===

Many places in the game use selection menus.  The pre-game menu is the 
first you will encounter; your item inventory is another, and so are 
the menus that pop up when you change your equipment, loot containers,
and in various other places.

Single-selection menus allow you to type one key letter; they then
vanish, passing the selection to the command that invoked them.

Multiple-selection menus are usually invoked by typing +?+ to some
selection prompt.  In a multi-select, the letter next to each item
type toggles a "to be selected" flag; you can see it's on when the +-+
after the letter becomes +++.  When you press Enter to exit the menu,
all flagged items are passed to the command that invoked the menu.

Select all can be done with +.+ (period) or +,+ (comma); "-" (minus)
is deselect all.

You can select part of a stack of like items in an inventory by
prefixing a number to the inventory letter.  Inventories also have
some special ways to toggle dselection of every item in various
categories; +%+ for comestibles, +!+ for potions, +"+ for amulets,
etc.

ESC aborts the selection and the command that invoked it, when it
makes sense for that to be possible.  If you have menu borders
enabled, mouse-clicking the "x" at the upper right will do the same
thing.

A long menu can be scrolled with +<+ (up), +>+ (down), or by arrow keys.

== Commands ==

Commands are initiated by typing one or two characters.  Some
commands, like +search+, do not require that any more information be
collected by NetHack.  Other commands might require additional
information, for example a direction, or an object to be used.  For
those commands that require additional information, NetHack will
present you with either a menu of choices, or with a command line
prompt requesting information.  Which you are presented with will
depend chiefly on how you have set the 'menustyle' option.

For example, a common question in the form +What do you want to
use? [a-zA-Z ?\*]+, asks you to choose an object you are carrying.
Here, ``a-zA-Z'' are the inventory letters of your possible choices.
Typing +?+ gives you an inventory list of these items, so you can see
what each letter refers to.  In this example, there is also a +\*+
indicating that you may choose an object not on the list, if you
wanted to use something unexpected.  Typing a +\*+ lists your entire
inventory, so you can see the inventory letters of every object you're
carrying.  Finally, if you change your mind and decide you don't want
to do this command after all, you can press the `ESC' key to abort the
command.

You can put a number before some commands to repeat them that many
times; for example, +10s+ will search ten times. Commands for which
counts make no sense ignore them.  In addition, movement commands can
be prefixed for greater control (see below).  To cancel a count or a
prefix, press the `ESC' key.

The list of commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time
during the game through the +?+ command, which accesses a menu of
helpful texts.  

Here are the commands for your reference.  Where a command has
multiple bindings, they're all listed in the same place.  The notation
[] has its usual meaning of "any of the individual characters
enclosed".  "C-x" is Control-x; "M-x" is  Alt-x.

+?+::
    Help menu:  display one of several help texts available.

+/+::
    Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a
    location or type a symbol (or even a whole word) to explain.
    Specifying a location is done by moving the cursor to a particular
    spot on the map and then pressing one of +.+ (period), +,+
    (comma), +;+ (semicolon), or +:+ (colon).  +.+ (period) will
    explain the symbol at the chosen location, conditionally check for
    +More info?+ depending upon whether the 'help' option is on, and
    then you will be asked to pick another location; +,+ (comma) will explain
    the symbol but skip any additional information; +;+ (semicolon) will skip
    additional info and also not bother asking you to choose another
    location to examine; +:+ (colon) will show additional info, if any,
    without asking for confirmation.  When picking a location,
    pressing the +ESC+ key will terminate this command, or pressing
    +?+ will give a brief reminder about how it works.
    Specifying a name rather than a location always gives any
    additional information available about that name.

+&+::
    Tell what a command does. Follow it with a command key.

+<+::
    Go up to the previous level (if you are on a staircase or ladder).

+>+::
    Go down to the next level (if you are on a staircase or ladder).

+[yuhjklbn]+::
    Go one step in the direction indicated (see Figure 2).  If you
    sense or remember a monster there, you will fight the monster
    instead.  Only these one-step movement commands cause you to fight
    monsters; the others (below) are ``safe.''
    Arrow keys should move you as you would expect. On a PC keyboard,
    Home and End and PgUp and PgDn will perform diagonal motions
    as you would expect.

.Figure 2

   b  j  n       1  2  3     End Down PgDn
----------------------------------------------

+[YUHJKLBN]+::
    Go in that direction until you hit a wall or run into something.

+Ctrl-[yuhjklbn]::
    Run until you see something interesting. Doesn't require that you
    collide with anything.

+m[yuhjklbn]+::
    Prefix: move without picking up objects or fighting (even if
    you remember a monster there), or move even if you believe the
    destination is dangerous terrain.

+F[yuhjklbn]+::
    Prefix: fight a monster (even if you only guess one is there).
    Useful for fighting peaceful monsters, pets, and shopkeepers
    (supposing you want to).

+g[yuhjklbn]+::
    Prefix:  Move until something interesting is found.

+G[yuhjklbn]+ or +<CONTROL>[yuhjklbn]+::
    Prefix:  Same as +g+, but forking of corridors is not considered
    interesting.

+_+::
    Travel to a map location via a shortest-path algorithm.  The
    shortest path is computed over map locations the hero knows about
    (e.g. seen or previously traversed).  If there is no known path, a
    guess is made instead.  Stops on most of the same conditions as
    the +G+ command, but without picking up objects, similar to the
    +M+ command (the 'movecommand' option is relevant).  For ports
    with mouse support, the command is also invoked when a mouse-click
    takes place on a location other than the current position (if the
    'mouse' option is on).

+.+::
    Rest, do nothing for one turn. Gradually restores your hit points 
    and power.

+a+::
    Apply (use) a tool or weapon (pick-axe, key, lamp). Some weapons
    also double as tools, and some tools can also be used as
    weapons. Doing +a,+ is a shortcut for applying a tool on the
    floor; ? will give you a single-selection menu.  Currently it only
    applies to containers.  Apply is also used to hit a monster two
    squares away with a polearm or lance.

+A+::
   Put on or remove one or more worn items, such as armor or rings.
   You will be offered a selection menu.

+C-A+::
   Continue an interrupted action that would take multiple
   turns, such as studying a spellbook; or, if you weren't
   interrupted, just redo the previous command.

+c+::
   Chat with a monster adjacent to you, or close a door.
   You'll be prompted for a direction.

+C M-n #name+::
    Call (name) individual things or classes

+C-C !+::
    Show a menu of generally applicable commands, including: changing
    options, viewing character statistics, and saving the game.

+d+::
    Drop an item. To drop some of an item you have multiples
    of, use a numeric prefix: +d7a+ --- drop seven items of object 'a'.

+D+::
    Drop several things.  Brings up a multi-select menu.

+C-D #kick+::
    Kick something (usually a door). You will be prompted for a direction.

+e+::
    Eat food. Use +e,+ to eat food or a corpse or other edible item
    you are standing on.

+E+::
    Engrave a message on the floor. Normally you will engrave with
    your weapon in hand; +E-+ writes in the dust with your fingers,
    which will also happen if you have nothing wielded. Note that
    engraving can blunt a blade, so it's best to do it with something
    cheap and disposable like a dagger. Takes multiple turns, and
    you can be interrupted by an attack.

+C-E+::
    Write the word ``Elbereth'' on the floor with your fingers.  This
    will cause most monsters to not attack you hand-to-hand (but if
    you attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give
    yourself a breather.  Takes a single turn.

+f+::
    Fire one of the objects placed in your quiver.  You may select
    ammunition with a previous +Q+ command, or let the computer pick
    something appropriate if 'autoquiver' is true.

+C-G+ M-g #grope::
    Feel the ground.  Like +:+ but can be used when blind and costs a turn.

+i+::
    List your inventory (everything you're carrying).  Note that if
    your display is sufficiently wide, an inventory list will be
    permanently displayed on the right hand side.

+I+::
    List selected parts of your inventory.  A menu of inventory parts 
    will appear.

+o+::
    Open a door.

+O+::
    Set options.  A menu showing the current option values will be
    displayed.  You can change most values simply by selecting the
    menu entry for the given option (ie, by typing its letter or
    clicking upon it, depending on your user interface).  For the
    non-boolean choices, a further menu or prompt will appear once
    you've closed this menu.  The available options are listed later
    in this Guidebook.  Some `birth' options are must be set before
    the game rather than with the +O+ command; see the section on
    options below.

+C-O+::
    Overview. Report on visited levels and the name of the current level,
    if it has one. Also report interesting features (like 
    shops and altars).

+p+::
    Pay your shopping bill.

+P+::
    Put on a ring or other accessory (amulet, blindfold).  Typing +?+
    to the prompt will get you a selection menu. This is an alias of
    +W+ retained for historical reasons; it may be removed in the future.

+C-P+::
    Browse the message history.

+q #quaff+::
   Quaff (drink) something (potion, water, etc). +q,+ quaffs from a 
   fountain or sink you are standing over.

+Q+::
    Select an object for your quiver.  You can then throw this using
    the `f' command.  (In versions prior to 3.3 this was the command to quit
    the game, which has now been moved to +S!+.)

+r+::
    Read a scroll or spellbook.

+R+::
    Remove an accessory (ring, amulet, etc). This is an alias of
    +T+ retained for historical reasons; it may be removed in the future.

+C-R+::
    Redraw the screen.

+s+::
    Search for secret doors and traps around you.  It usually takes several
    tries to find something.

+S+::
    Save (and suspend) the game.  You can have multiple games in
    progress. +S!+ is save-quit and abandons a game you are no longer
    interested in, deleting the save file.

+t+::
    Throw an object or shoot a projectile.  Some projectiles, such as
    darts and shurikens, can be thrown with the hand. Others require
    you to wield a compatible launcher (arrows require bows; crossbows
    require bolts; stones require slings) first to be effective. Some
    weapons (such as daggers, spears, and javelins) can be used
    effectively either in melee or thrown; most aren't effective if
    you try to use them at the wrong range.

+T+::
    Take off armor or jewelry or other accessories.

+C-T+::
    Teleport, if you have the ability.

+v+::
    Automatically explore until something happens. 

+V M-i M-v #invoke+::

+w+::
    Wield weapon.  To wield nothing, use your bare hands, +w-+.

+W+::
    Wear armor or jewelry or other accessories.

+x+::
    Exchange your wielded weapon with the item in your alternate
    weapon slot.  The latter is used as your secondary weapon when
    engaging in two-weapon combat.  Note that if one of these slots is
    empty, the exchange still takes place.

+X M-2 M-x #twoweapon+::
    Toggle two-weapon combat on or off.  Note that you must
    use suitable weapons for this type of combat, or it will
    be automatically turned off.

+C-X+::
    Display your name, role, race, gender, and alignment as well as
    the various deities in your game.

+z+::
    Zap a wand.  You may be prompted for a direction. To aim at
    yourself, use +.+ (period) for the direction.

+Z+::
    Zap (cast) a spell.  You will be prompted for a direction. To cast
    at yourself, use +.+ (period) for the direction.

+C-Z+::
    Suspend the game (UNIX versions with job control only).

+:+::
    Look at what is here (where you are standing).

+;+::
    Show what type of thing a visible symbol corresponds to. Move the
    cursor to what you wish to examine and press Enter or +.+
    (period). This will also list other information about the square:
    terrain type, trap, topmost item, and any monster you see or
    remember on the square.

+,+::
    Pick up some items. You'll get a selection menu; typing each
    letter toggles the to-be-taken flag on the item, which you can see
    because the +-+ after the letter becomes +++ when it;'s on.  When
    you press enter to leave the menu, you pick up all flagged objects.

+@+::
    Toggle the 'autopickup' option on and off.

+^+::
    Ask for the type of a trap you found earlier.

+)+::
    Tell what weapon you are wielding.

+*+::
    Tell what equipment you are using; combines the preceding five type-specific
    commands into one.

+$+::
    Count your gold pieces, or display your unpaid shopping bill or
    shop credit.

+++::
    List the spells you know.  Using this command, you can also rearrange
    the order in which your spells are listed.  They are shown via a menu,
    and if you select a spell in that menu, you'll be re-prompted for
    another spell to swap places with it, and then have opportunity to
    make further exchanges. You can also assign arbitrary letters.

+\\+::
    Show what types of objects have been discovered.

+M-a #adjust+::

    Force a lock; usually requires you to be wielding a weapon, and
    may damage the weapon.  If the locked object has been trapped the
    trap may trigger.

+M-j #jump+::
    Jump to another location.

+M-l #loot+::
    Loot a box or bag on the floor beneath you, or the saddle

== Rooms and corridors ==

Rooms and corridors in the dungeon are either lit or dark.
Any lit areas within your line of sight will be displayed;
dark areas are only displayed if they are within one space of you. 

Walls and corridors remain on the map as you explore them.

Secret corridors are hidden.  You can find them with the +s+ (search)
command.

=== Doorways ===

Doorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no doors;
you can walk right through.  Others have doors in them, which may be
open, closed, or locked.  To open or close a door, use the +o+
command.  Closing can also be done with +c+ for historical reasons.

You can get through a locked door by using a tool to pick the lock
with the +a+ (apply) command, or by kicking it open with the
C-D+ (kick) command.  If you do +o+ and have an unlocking device it
will ve applied automatically.

Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach them
straight on, horizontally or vertically.  Doorways without doors are
not restricted in this fashion.

Doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most monsters cannot
open doors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts can walk through
doors).

Secret doors are hidden.  You can find them with the +s+ (search)
command.  Once found they are in all ways equivalent to normal doors.

=== Traps (+^+) ===

There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary delver.
For example, you may suddenly fall into a pit and be stuck for a few
turns trying to climb out.  Traps don't appear on your map until you
see one triggered by moving onto it, see something fall into it, or you
discover it with the +s+ (search) command.  Monsters can fall prey to
traps, too, which can be a very useful defensive strategy.

There is a special pre-mapped branch of the dungeon based on the
classic computer game 'Sokoban'.  The goal is to push the boulders
into the pits or holes.  With careful foresight, it is possible to
complete all of the levels according to the traditional rules of
Sokoban.  Some allowances are permitted in case the player gets stuck;
however, they will lower your luck.

=== Stairs (+<+, +>+)  ===

In general, each level in the dungeon will have a staircase going up
(+<+) to the previous level and another going down (+>+)
to the next level.  

There are some exceptions, though.  For instance, fairly early in the
dungeon you will find a level with two down staircases, one continuing
into the dungeon and the other branching into an area known as the
Gnomish Mines.  Those mines eventually hit a dead end, so after
exploring them (if you choose to do so), you'll need to climb back up
to the main dungeon.  Stairs to or out of a branch (also known as long
stairs) will normally be underlined, resembling greater-than-or-equal
and less-than-or-equal signs.

When you traverse a set of stairs, or trigger a trap which sends you
to another level, the level you're leaving will be deactivated and
stored.  If you're moving to a previously visited level, it will be
reloaded and reactivated.  If you're moving to a level which has not
yet been visited, it will be created (from scratch for most random
levels, from a template for some ``special'' levels, or loaded from
the remains of an earlier game for a ``bones'' level as briefly
described below).  Monsters are only active on the current level;
those on other levels are essentially placed into stasis.  Ordinarily
when you climb a set of stairs, you will arrive on the corresponding
staircase at your destination.  However, pets (see below) and some
other monsters will follow along if they're close enough when you
travel up or down stairs, and occasionally one of these creatures will
displace you during the climb.  When that occurs, the pet or other
monster will arrive on the staircase and you will end up nearby.

=== Ladders (+<+, +>+)  ===

Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases, and the two types of
inter-level connections are nearly indistinguishable during game play.

=== Shops and shopping ===

Occasionally you will run across a room with a shopkeeper near the door
and many items lying on the floor.  You can buy items by picking them
up and then using the +p+ command.  You can inquire about the price
of an item prior to picking it up by using the +#chat+ command
while standing on it.  Using an item prior to paying for it will incur a
charge, and the shopkeeper won't allow you to leave the shop until you
have paid any debt you owe.

You can sell items to a shopkeeper by dropping them to the floor while
inside a shop.  You will either be offered an amount of gold and asked
whether you're willing to sell, or you'll be told that the shopkeeper
isn't interested (generally, your item needs to be compatible with the
type of merchandise carried by the shop).

If you drop something in a shop by accident, the shopkeeper will usually
claim ownership without offering any compensation.  You'll have to buy
it back if you want to reclaim it.

Shopkeepers sometimes run out of money.  When that happens, you'll be
offered credit instead of gold when you try to sell something.  Credit
can be used to pay for purchases, but it is only good in the shop where
it was obtained; other shopkeepers won't honor it.  (If you happen to
find a ``credit card'' in the dungeon, don't bother trying to use it in
shops; shopkeepers will not accept it.)

The +$+ command, which reports the amount of gold you are carrying
(in inventory, not inside bags or boxes), will also show current shop
debt or credit, if any.  The +Iu+ command lists unpaid items
(those which still belong to the shop) if you are carrying any.
The +Ix+ command shows an inventory-like display of any unpaid
items which have been used up, along with other shop fees, if any.

==== Shop idiosyncracies ====

Several aspects of shop behavior might be unexpected.

* The price of a given item can vary due to a variety of factors.

* A shopkeeper treats the spot immediately inside the door as if it were
  outside the shop.

* While the shopkeeper watches you like a hawk, he will generally ignore
  any other customers.

* If a shop is ``closed for inventory'', it will not open of its own accord.

* Shops do not get restocked with new items, regardless of inventory depletion.

== Monsters ==

Monsters you cannot see are not displayed on the screen.  Beware!
You may suddenly come upon one in a dark place.  Some magic items can
help you locate them before they locate you (which some monsters can do
very well).

The commands +/+ (forward slash) and +;+ (semicolon) may be used to
obtain information about those monsters who are displayed on the
screen.  The command +C+ allows you to assign a name to a monster,
which may be useful to help distinguish one from another when multiple
monsters are present.  Assigning a name which is just a space will
remove any prior name.

The extended command +#chat+ can be used to interact with an adjacent
monster.  There is no actual dialog (in other words, you don't get to
choose what you'll say), but chatting with some monsters such as a
shopkeeper or the Oracle of Delphi can produce useful results.

=== Fighting ===

If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to walk
into it.  Many monsters you find will mind their own business unless
you attack them.  Some of them are very dangerous when angered.
Remember:  discretion is the better part of valor.

If you can't see a monster (if it is invisible, or if you are
blinded), the symbol +I+ will be shown when you learn of its presence.
If you attempt to walk into it, you will try to fight it just like a
monster that you can see; of course, if the monster has moved, you
will attack empty air.  If you guess that the monster has moved and
you don't wish to fight, you can use the `m' command to move without
fighting; likewise, if you don't remember a monster but want to try
fighting anyway, you can use the +F+ command.

=== Your pet ===

You start the game with a little dog (+d+), cat (+f+), or pony (+u+),
which follows you about the dungeon and fights monsters with you.
Like you, your pet needs food to survive.  It usually feeds itself on
fresh carrion and other meats.  If you're worried about it or want to
train it, you can feed it, too, by throwing it food.  A properly
trained pet can be very useful under certain circumstances.

Your pet also gains experience from killing monsters, and can grow
over time, gaining hit points and doing more damage.  Initially, your
pet may even be better at killing things than you, which makes pets
useful for low-level characters.

Your pet will follow you up and down staircases if it is next to you
when you move.  Otherwise your pet will be stranded and may become
wild.  Similarly, when you trigger certain types of traps which alter
your location (for instance, a trap door which drops you to a lower
dungeon level), any adjacent pet will accompany you and any non-adjacent
pet will be left behind.  Your pet may trigger such traps itself; you
will not be carried along with it even if adjacent at the time.

=== Steeds ===

Some types of creatures in the dungeon can actually be ridden if you
have the right equipment and skill.  Convincing a wild beast to let
you saddle it up is difficult to say the least.  Many a dungeoneer
has had to resort to magic and wizardry in order to forge the alliance.
Once you do have the beast under your control however, you can
easily climb in and out of the saddle with the +#ride+ command.  Lead
the beast around the dungeon when riding, in the same manner as
you would move yourself.  It is the beast that you will see displayed
on the map.

Riding skill is managed by the +#enhance+ command.  See the section
on Weapon proficiency for more information about that.

=== Bones levels ===

You may encounter the shades and corpses of other adventurers (or even
former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal effects.  Ghosts
are hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little
damage.  You can plunder the deceased adventurer's possessions;
however, they are likely to be cursed.  Beware of whatever killed the
former player; it is probably still lurking around, gloating over its
last victory.

== Objects ==

When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick
it up.  In 'NetHack', this is accomplished automatically by walking over
the object (unless you turn off the 'autopickup'
option (see below), or move with the +m+ prefix (see above)), or
manually by using the +,+ (comma) command.

If you're carrying too many items, NetHack will tell you so and you
won't be able to pick up anything more. Otherwise, it will add the
object(s) to your pack and tell you what you just picked up.  As you
add items to your inventory, you also add the weight of that object to
your load.  The amount that you can carry depends on your strength and
your constitution.  The stronger you are, the less the additional load
will affect you.

There comes a point, though, when the weight of all of that stuff you
are carrying around with you through the dungeon will encumber you.
Your reactions will get slower and you'll burn calories faster,
requiring food more frequently to cope with it.  Eventually, you'll be
so overloaded that you'll either have to discard some of what you're
carrying or collapse under its weight.  NetHack will tell you how
badly you have loaded yourself.  The symbols `Burdened', `Stressed',
`Strained', `Overtaxed' and `Overloaded' are displayed on the bottom
line display to indicate your condition.

When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory letter.  Many
commands that operate on objects must ask you to find out which object
you want to use.  When NetHack asks you to choose a particular object
you are carrying, you are usually presented with a list of inventory
letters to choose from (see Commands, above).

You can check your weight allowance using +C-x+; the weight of each
item in your inventory is listed after it in curly braces.

Some objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated.  Others, like
scrolls and potions, are given descriptions which vary according to
type.  During a game, any two objects with the same description are
the same type.  However, the descriptions will vary from game to game.

When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious, NetHack
will remember what it is for you.  If its effect isn't extremely
obvious, you will be asked what you want to call this type of object
so you will recognize it later.  You can also use the +#name+
command for the same purpose at any time, to name all objects of a
particular type or just an individual object.

When you use +#name+ on an object which has already been named,
specifying a space as the value will remove the prior name instead
of assigning a new one.

=== Curses and Blessings ===

Any object that you find may be cursed, even if the object is
otherwise helpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being stuck
with (and to) the item.  Cursed weapons weld themselves to your hand
when wielded, so you cannot unwield them.  Any cursed item you wear
is not removable by ordinary means.  In addition, cursed arms and armor
usually, but not always, bear negative enchantments that make them
less effective in combat.  Other cursed objects may act poorly or
detrimentally in other ways.

Objects can also be blessed.  Blessed items usually work better or
more beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For example, a blessed
weapon will do more damage against demons.

There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon objects,
so even if you are stuck with one, you can still have the curse
lifted and the item removed.  Priests and Priestesses have an innate
sensitivity to this property in any object, so they can more easily avoid
cursed objects than other character roles.

An item with unknown status will be reported in your inventory with no prefix.
An item which you know the state of will be distinguished in your inventory
by the presence of the word ``cursed'', ``uncursed'' or ``blessed'' in the
description of the item.

=== Weapons (+)+)  ===

Given a chance, most monsters in the Mazes of Menace will gratuitously try to
kill you.  You need weapons for self-defense (killing them first).  Without a
weapon, you do only 1--2 hit points of damage (plus bonuses, if any).
Monk characters are an exception; they normally do much more damage with
bare hands than they do with weapons.

There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown weapons,
like arrows and spears.  To hit monsters with a weapon, you must wield it and
attack them, or throw it at them.  You can simply elect to throw a spear.
To shoot an arrow, you should first wield a bow, then throw the arrow.
Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts.  Slings hurl rocks and (other) stones
(like gems).

Enchanted weapons have a ``plus'' (or ``to hit enhancement'' which can
be either positive or negative) that adds to your chance to hit and
the damage you do to a monster.  The only way to determine a weapon's
enchantment is to have it magically identified somehow.  Most weapons
are subject to some type of damage like rust.  Such ``erosion'' damage
can be repaired.

The chance that an attack will successfully hit a monster, and the amount
of damage such a hit will do, depends upon many factors.  Among them are:
type of weapon, quality of weapon (enchantment and/or erosion), experience
level, strength, dexterity, encumbrance, and proficiency (see below).  The
monster's armor class---a general defense rating, not necessarily due to
wearing of armor---is a factor too; also, some monsters are particularly
vulnerable to certain types of weapons.

Many weapons can be wielded in one hand; some require both hands.
When wielding a two-handed weapon, you cannot wear a shield, and
vice versa.  When wielding a one-handed weapon, you can have another
weapon ready to use by setting things up with the +x+ command, which
exchanges your primary (the one being wielded) and alternate weapons.
And if you have proficiency in the ``two weapon combat'' skill, you
may wield both weapons simultaneously as primary and secondary; use the
+#twoweapon+ extended command to engage or disengage that.  Only
some types of characters (barbarians, for instance) have the necessary
skill available.  Even with that skill, using two weapons at once incurs
a penalty in the chance to hit your target compared to using just one
weapon at a time.

There might be times when you'd rather not wield any weapon at all.
To accomplish that, wield +-+, or else use the +A+ command which
allows you to unwield the current weapon in addition to taking off
other worn items.

Those of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware that each
weapon which existed in AD&D does roughly the same damage to monsters in
NetHack.  Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the
'aklys', 'lucern hammer', and 'bec-de-corbin') are defined
in an appendix to 'Unearthed Arcana', an AD&D supplement.

The commands to use weapons are +w+ (wield), +t+ (throw),
+f+ (fire, an alternative way of throwing), +Q+ (quiver),
+x+ (exchange), +#twoweapon+, and +#enhance+ (see below).

=== Throwing and shooting ===

You can throw just about anything via the +t+ command.  It will prompt
for the item to throw; picking +?+ will list things in your inventory
which are considered likely to be thrown, or picking +*+ will list
your entire inventory.  After you've chosen what to throw, you will
be prompted for a direction rather than for a specific target. 

The distance something can be thrown depends mainly on the type of
object and your strength.

Some projectiles, such as darts and shurikens, can be thrown with the
hand. Others require you to wield a compatible launcher (arrows
require bows; crossbows require bolts; stones require slings) first to
be effective. Some weapons (such as daggers, spears, and javelins) can
be used effectively either in melee or thrown; most aren't effective
if you try to use them at the wrong range.

You can simplify the throwing operation by using the +Q+ command to
select your preferred ``missile'', then using the +f+ command to throw
it.  You'll be prompted for a direction as above, but you don't have
to specify which item to throw each time you use +f+.  There is also
an option, 'autoquiver', which has NetHack choose another item to
automatically fill your quiver when the inventory slot used for +Q+
runs out.

Some characters have the ability to fire a volley of multiple items in
a single turn.  Knowing how to load several rounds of ammunition at
once---or hold several missiles in your hand---and still hit a target
is not an easy task.  Rangers are among those who are adept at this
task, as are those with a high level of proficiency in the relevant
weapon skill (in bow skill if you're wielding one to shoot arrows, in
crossbow skill if you're wielding one to shoot bolts, or in sling
skill if you're wielding one to shoot stones).  The number of items
that the character has a chance to fire varies from turn to turn.  You
can explicitly limit the number of shots by using a numeric prefix
before the +t+ or +f+ command.  For example, +2f+ 
would ensure that at most 2 arrows are shot even if
you could have fired 3.  If you specify a larger number than would
have been shot +4f+ in this example), you'll just end up shooting
the same number (3, here) as if no limit had been specified.  Once the
volley is in motion, all of the items will travel in the same
direction; if the first ones kill a monster, the others can still
continue beyond that spot.

=== Weapon proficiency ===

You will have varying degrees of skill in the weapons available.
Weapon proficiency, or weapon skills, affect how well you can use
particular types of weapons, and you'll be able to improve your skills
as you progress through a game, depending on your role, your experience
level, and use of the weapons.

For the purposes of proficiency, weapons have
been divided up into various groups such as daggers, broadswords, and
polearms.  Each role has a limit on what level of proficiency a character
can achieve for each group.  For instance, wizards can become highly
skilled in daggers or staves but not in swords or bows.

The +#enhance+ extended command is used to review current weapons proficiency
(also spell proficiency) and to choose which skill(s) to improve when
you've used one or more skills enough to become eligible to do so.  The
skill rankings are ``none'' (sometimes also referred to as ``restricted'',
because you won't be able to advance), ``unskilled'', ``basic'', ``skilled'',
and ``expert''.  Restricted skills simply will not appear in the list
shown by +#enhance+.  (Divine intervention might unrestrict a particular
skill, in which case it will start at unskilled and be limited to basic.)
Some characters can enhance their barehanded combat or martial arts skill
beyond expert to ``master'' or ``grand master''.

Use of a weapon in which you're restricted or unskilled
will incur a modest penalty in the chance to hit a monster and also in
the amount of damage done when you do hit; at basic level, there is no
penalty or bonus; at skilled level, you receive a modest bonus in the
chance to hit and amount of damage done; at expert level, the bonus is
higher.  A successful hit has a chance to boost your training towards
the next skill level (unless you've already reached the limit for this
skill).  Once such training reaches the threshold for that next level,
you'll be told that you feel more confident in your skills.  At that
point you can use +#enhance+ to increase one or more skills.  Such skills
are not increased automatically because there is a limit to your total
overall skills, so you need to actively choose which skills to enhance
and which to ignore.

=== Armor (+[+) ===

Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect
yourself from their blows.  Some types of armor offer better
protection than others.  Your Defence (the Def stat on the screen) is
a measure of this protection.  It starts at 10 when you have no armor.

Defense is modified by your armor class (AC) is measured as in Third
Edition D&D, with AC 0 being the equivalent of no armor, and higher
numbers meaning better armor.  Each type of armor which exists in D&D
gives the same protection in NetHack.  Here is an (incomplete) list of
the armor classes provided by various suits of armor:

[align="center",width="30%"]
|===========================
|dragon scale mail      | +9
|plate mail             | +7
|crystal plate mail     | +7
|bronze plate mail      | +6
|splint mail            | +6
|banded mail            | +6
|dwarvish mithril-coat  | +6
|elven mithril-coat     | +5
|chain mail             | +5
|orcish chain mail      | +4
|scale mail             | +4
|studded leather armor  | +3
|ring mail              | +3
|orcish ring mail       | +2
|leather armor          | +2
|leather jacket         | +1
|no armor               | +0
|===========================

You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex. helmets, boots, shields,
cloaks) to improve your defense even further, but you can only wear
one item of each category (one suit of armor, one cloak, one helmet,
one shield, and so on) at a time.

If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be better
(or worse) than normal, and its ``plus'' (or minus) will add to
your armor class.  For example, a +1 chain mail would give you
better protection than normal chain mail, raising your defence one
level further to 6.  When you put on a piece of armor, you immediately
find out the armor class and any ``plusses'' it provides.  Cursed
pieces of armor usually have negative enchantments (minuses) in
addition to being unremovable.

Many types of armor are subject to some kind of damage like rust.  Such
damage can be repaired.  Some types of armor may inhibit spell casting.

The commands to use armor are +W+ (wear) and +T+ (take off).
The +A+ command can also be used to take off armor as well as other
worn items.

=== Food (%) ===

Food is necessary to survive.  If you go too long without eating you
will faint, and eventually die of starvation.  Some types of food will
spoil, and become unhealthy to eat, if not protected.  Food stored in
ice boxes or tins (``cans'') will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes
are heavy, and tins take a while to open.

When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are also
``food.''  Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also give you
special powers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb is ``you are
what you eat.''

Some character roles and some monsters are vegetarian.  Vegetarian monsters
will typically never eat animal corpses, while vegetarian players can,
but with some rather unpleasant side-effects.

You can name one food item after something you like to eat with the
'fruit' option.

The command to eat food is +e+.  To eat a corpse you are standing
over use +e,+.

=== Scrolls (?) ===

Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen by ancient wizards
for their amusement value (ex. ``READ ME,'' or ``THANX MAUD'' backwards).
Scrolls disappear after you read them (except for blank ones, without
magic spells on them).

One of the most useful of these is the 'scroll of identify', which can
be used to determine what another object is, whether it is cursed or
blessed, and how many uses it has left.  Some objects of subtle
enchantment are difficult to identify without these.

//A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a 'scroll of mail'
//(on versions compiled with this feature).  To use this feature on
//versions where NetHack mail delivery is triggered by electronic mail
//appearing in your system mailbox, you must let NetHack know where to
//look for new mail by setting the ``MAIL'' environment variable to the
//file name of your mailbox.  You may also want to set the
//``MAILREADER'' environment variable to the file name of your favorite
//reader, so NetHack can shell to it when you read the scroll.  On
//versions of NetHack where mail is randomly generated internal to the
//game, these environment variables are ignored.  You can disable the
//mail daemon by turning off the 'mail' option.

The command to read a scroll is +r+.

=== Potions (+!+) ===

Potions are distinguished by the color of the liquid inside the flask.
They disappear after you quaff them.

Clear potions are potions of water.  Sometimes these are
blessed or cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water is
the bane of the undead, so potions of holy water are good things to
throw (+t+) at them.  It is also sometimes very useful to dip
(+#dip+) an object into a potion.

Potions can somrtimes be mixed for interesting effects.

The command to drink a potion is +q+ (quaff).

=== Wands (+/+) ===

Magic wands usually have multiple magical charges.  Some wands are
directional---you must give a direction in which to zap them.  You can also
zap them at yourself (just give a +.+ or +s+ for the direction).
Be warned, however, for this is often unwise.  Other wands are
nondirectional---they don't require a direction.  The number of charges in a
wand is random and decreases by one whenever you use it.

When the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero, attempts to use the
wand will usually result in nothing happening.  Occasionally, however, it may
be possible to squeeze the last few mana points from an otherwise spent wand,
destroying it in the process.  A wand may be recharged by using suitable
magic, but doing so runs the risk of causing it to explode.  The chance
for such an explosion starts out very small and increases each time the
wand is recharged.

In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against the wall, you
might decide to go for broke and break your wand.  This is not for the faint
of heart.  Doing so will almost certainly cause a catastrophic release of
magical energies.

When you have fully identified a particular wand, inventory display will
include additional information in parentheses: the number of times it has
been recharged followed by a colon and then by its current number of charges.
A current charge count of +-1+ is a special case indicating that the wand
has been cancelled.

The command to use a wand is +z+ (zap).  To break a wand, use the +V+
(invoke) command.

=== Rings (+=+) ===

Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively permanent
magic, unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and
wands.

Putting on a ring activates its magic.  You can wear only two
rings, one on each ring finger.

Most rings also cause you to grow hungry more rapidly, the rate
varying with the type of ring.

The commands to use rings are +W+ (wear) and +T+ (take off).

=== Spellbooks (+++) ===

Spellbooks are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the +r+ (read)
command, they transfer to the reader the knowledge of a spell (and
therefore eventually become unreadable) --- unless the attempt backfires.
Reading a cursed spellbook or one with mystic runes beyond
your ken can be harmful to your health!

A spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you cast it.  If you
attempt to cast a spell well above your experience level, or if you have
little skill with the appropriate spell type, or cast it at
a time when your luck is particularly bad, you can end up wasting both the
energy and the time required in casting.

Casting a spell calls forth magical energies and focuses them with
your naked mind.  Some of the magical energy released comes from within
you, and casting several spells in a row may tire you.
Casting of spells also requires practice.  With practice, your
skill in each category of spell casting will improve.  Over time, however,
your memory of each spell will dim, and you will need to relearn it.

Some spells are directional---you must give a direction in which to
cast them.  You can also cast them at yourself (just give a +.+
(period) or +s+ for the direction).  Be warned, however, for this is
often unwise.  Other spells are nondirectional---they don't require a
direction.

Just as weapons are divided into groups in which a character can become
proficient (to varying degrees), spells are similarly grouped.
Successfully casting a spell exercises the skill group; sufficient skill
may increase the potency of the spell and reduce the risk of spell failure.
Skill slots are shared with weapons skills.  (See also the section on
``Weapon proficiency''.)

Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing various types
of armor may interfere with that.

The command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls, +r+
(read).  The +++ command lists your current spells, their levels,
categories, and chances for failure.  The +Z+ (cast) command casts a
spell.

=== Tools (+(+) ===

Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes.  Some tools
have a limited number of uses, akin to wand charges.  For example, lamps burn
out after a while.  Other tools are containers, which objects can
be placed into or taken out of.

The command to use tools is +a+ (apply).

=== Containers ===

You may encounter bags, boxes, and chests in your travels.  A tool of
this sort can be opened with the +#loot+ extended command when you are
standing on top of it (that is, on the same floor spot), or with the
+a+ (apply) command when you are carrying it.  However, chests are
often locked, and are in any case unwieldy objects.  You must set one
down before unlocking it by using a key or lock-picking tool with the
+a+ (apply) command, by kicking it with the +C-D+ command, or by using
a weapon to force the lock with the +#force+ extended command.

Some chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when you
unlock or open them.  You can check for and try to deactivate traps
with the +#untrap+ extended command.

=== Amulets (+"+) ===

Amulets are very similar to rings, and often more powerful.  Like
rings, amulets have various magical properties, some beneficial,
some harmful, which are activated by putting them on.

Only one amulet may be worn at a time, around your neck.

The commands to use amulets are the same as for rings, +W+ (wear)
and +T+ (take off).

=== Gems (+*+) ===

Some gems are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold.  They are also
a far more efficient way of carrying your riches.  Valuable gems increase
your score if you bring them with you when you exit.

Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are much less
valuable.  All rocks, however, can be used as projectile weapons (if you
have a sling).  In the most desperate of cases, you can still throw them
by hand.

=== Large rocks (+`+) ===

Statues and boulders are not particularly useful, and are generally
heavy.  It is rumored that some statues are not what they seem.

Very large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been known to use boulders
as weapons.

=== Gold (+$+) ===

Gold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops with it.
There are a number of monsters in the dungeon that may be influenced
by the amount of gold you are carrying (shopkeepers aside).

== Conduct ==

As if winning NetHack were not difficult enough, certain players
seek to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions on the
way they play the game.  The game automatically tracks some of
these challenges, which can be checked at any time with the +#conduct+
command or at the end of the game.  When you perform an action which
breaks a challenge, it will no longer be listed.  This gives
players extra ``bragging rights'' for winning the game with these
challenges.  Note that it is perfectly acceptable to win the game
without resorting to these restrictions and that it is unusual for
players to adhere to challenges the first time they win the game.

Several of the challenges are related to eating behavior.  The most
difficult of these is the foodless challenge.  Although creatures
can survive long periods of time without food, there is a physiological
need for water; thus there is no restriction on drinking beverages,
even if they provide some minor food benefits.
Calling upon your god for help with starvation does
not violate any food challenges either.

A strict vegan diet is one which avoids any food derived from animals.
The primary source of nutrition is fruits and vegetables.  The
corpses and tins of blobs (`b'), jellies (`j'), and fungi (`F') are
also considered to be vegetable matter.  Certain human
food is prepared without animal products; namely, lembas wafers, cram
rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations, and C-rations.
Metal or another normally indigestible material eaten while polymorphed
into a creature that can digest it is also considered vegan food.
Note however that eating such items still counts against foodless conduct.

Vegetarians do not eat animals;
however, they are less selective about eating animal byproducts than vegans.
In addition to the vegan items listed above, they may eat any kind
of pudding (`P') other than the black puddings,
eggs and food made from eggs (fortune cookies and pancakes),
food made with milk (cream pies and candy bars), and lumps of
royal jelly.  Monks are expected to observe a vegetarian diet.

Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan, and foodless
conducts.  This includes tripe rations, the corpses or tins of any
monsters not mentioned above, and the various other chunks of meat
found in the dungeon.  Swallowing and digesting a monster while polymorphed
is treated as if you ate the creature's corpse.
Eating leather, dragon hide, or bone items while
polymorphed into a creature that can digest it, or eating monster brains
while polymorphed into a mind flayer, is considered eating
an animal, although wax is only an animal byproduct.

Regardless of conduct, there will be some items which are indigestible,
and others which are hazardous to eat.  Using a swallow-and-digest
attack against a monster is equivalent to eating the monster's corpse.
Please note that the term ``vegan'' is used here only in the context of
diet.  You are still free to choose not to use or wear items derived
from animals (e.g. leather, dragon hide, bone, horns, coral), but the
game will not keep track of this for you.  Also note that ``milky''
potions may be a translucent white, but they do not contain milk,
so they are compatible with a vegan diet.  Slime molds or
player-defined ``fruits'', although they could be anything
from ``cherries'' to ``pork chops'', are also assumed to be vegan.

An atheist is one who rejects religion.  This means that you cannot
+#pray+, +#offer+ sacrifices to any god,
+#turn+ undead, or +#chat+ with a priest.
Particularly selective readers may argue that playing Monk or Priest
characters should violate this conduct; that is a choice left to the
player.  Offering the Amulet of Yendor to your god is necessary to
win the game and is not counted against this conduct.  You are also
not penalized for being spoken to by an angry god, priest(ess), or
other religious figure; a true atheist would hear the words but
attach no special meaning to them.

Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or tool intended to be
wielded as a weapon).  Another challenge is to win the game without
using such a wielded weapon.  You are still permitted to throw,
fire, and kick weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type of item;
or fight with your hands and feet.

In NetHack, a pacifist refuses to cause the death of any other monster
(i.e. if you would get experience for the death).  This is a particularly
difficult challenge, although it is still possible to gain experience
by other means.

An illiterate character cannot read or write.  This includes reading
a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or t-shirt; writing a
scroll; or making an engraving of anything other than a single ``x'' (the
traditional signature of an illiterate person).  Reading an engraving,
or any item that is absolutely necessary to win the game, is not counted
against this conduct.  The identity of scrolls and spellbooks (and
knowledge of spells) in your starting inventory is assumed to be
learned from your teachers prior to the start of the game and isn't
counted.

There are several other challenges tracked by the game.  It is possible
to eliminate one or more species of monsters by genocide; playing without
this feature is considered a challenge.  When the game offers you an
opportunity to genocide monsters, you may respond with the monster type
``none'' if you want to decline.  You can change the form of an item into
another item of the same type (``polypiling'') or the form of your own
body into another creature (``polyself'') by wand, spell, or potion of
polymorph; avoiding these effects are each considered challenges.
Polymorphing monsters, including pets, does not break either of these
challenges.
Finally, you may sometimes receive wishes; a game without an attempt to
wish for any items is a challenge, as is a game without wishing for
an artifact (even if the artifact immediately disappears).  When the
game offers you an opportunity to make a wish for an item, you may
choose ``nothing'' if you want to decline.

== Options ==

Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how NetHack
should do things, there are options you can set to change how NetHack
behaves.

=== Setting the options ===

Options may be set in a number of ways.  Within the game, the +O+
command allows you to view all options and change most of them.
Some (the so-called "birth options" need to be set before game start
through the `set options' choice in nethack4's initial dialog.

You can also set options automatically by placing them
in a configuration file.  Normally, though, the configuration
files are edited through the game and should not need to be
hand-hacked.

nethack4 has two configuration files. One, 'curses.conf', is for
UI-specific options. The other, 'Nethack4.conf', is for general
gameplay options. UI options are marked in the list below. Some
options are in the wrong place for hysterical raisins may move in the
futre.

NETHACK4OPTIONS can be set to the configuration file name for
non-UI-specific options (except on Windows); otherwise, it looks in
CONFIG_DIR/curses.conf (UI options), CONFIG_DIR/NetHack4.conf, where
CONFIG_DIR refers to AppData on Windows or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/NetHack4
on non-Windows (with a fallback to ~/.config/NetHack4)

=== Customization options ===

These files contain one option on each line, except for lines
beginning with a # which are treated as comments to be ignored.
Each option setting consists of an otio name, followed by an equals
sign, followed by a value.

Here are explanations of what the various options do.
Character strings that are too long may be truncated.
Some of the options listed may be inactive in your dungeon.

==== Birth options ====

These cannot generally be set in-game with the +O+ command, only from
the pre-game options menu.

'name'::
    Set your character's name (defaults to your user name).

'mode'::
    Can be 'normal' (default), 'explore', or 'debug'.  The 'explore'
    mode is like involing the game with -X; it starts you with a
    Wand of Wishing and infinite lifesaving, but your score will
    not appear on the scoreboard.  The 'debug' mode is for nethack
    developers.

'elbereth'::
    The E-word repels monsters (default on). Turn off to increase
    game difficulty.

'reincarnation'::
    Enables some special Rogue-like levels (default on).  These use
    the graphics conventions of the original Rogue.

'seduction'::
    Certain monsters may attempt seduce you (default on).  This can
    improve or degrade your abilities.

'bones'::
    Allow bones level to exist (default on).  A bones level is one
    preserved from a player death, with a grave, the player's
    artifacts - and whatever killed the player still around.

'permablind'::
    Spend the whole game blind (default off). Raises the difficulty
    level.

'permahallu'::
    Spend the whole game hallucinating (default off). Raises the
    difficulty level.

'polyinit'::
    Play as a monster (default off). You get to choose the monster type.
    Scores for such games are not recorded.

'legacy'::
    Display an introductory message when starting the game (default on).

'align'::
    Your starting alignment (+align=lawful+, +align=neutral+,
    or +align=chaotic+).  You may specify just the first letter.
    The default is to randomly pick an appropriate alignment.

'gender'::
    Your starting gender (+gender=male+ or +gender=female+).
    You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
    still denote your gender using the +male+ and +female+
    options, the +gender+ option will take precedence.
    The default is to randomly pick an appropriate gender.

'race'::
    Selects your race (for example, +race=human+).  Default is random.

'role'::
    Pick your type of character (ex. +role:Samurai+);
    synonym for 'character'.  See 'name' for an alternate method
    of specifying your role.  Normally only the first letter of the
    value is examined; `r' is an exception with +Rogue+, +Ranger+,
    and +random+ values.

'catname'::
    Name your starting cat (ex. +catname=Morris+).

'dogname'::
    Name your starting dog (ex. +dogname=Fang+).

'horsename'::
    Name your starting horse (ex. +horsename=Trigger+).
    Cannot be set with the +O+ command.

'pettype'::
    Specify the type of your initial pet, if you are playing a character class
    that uses multiple types of pets; or choose to have no initial pet at all.
    Possible values are +cat+, +dog+ and +none+.

=== Gameplay options ===

'autodig'::
    Automatically dig if you are wielding a digging tool and moving
    into a place that can be dug (default off).

'autodigdown'::
    Autodig downwards tries to create a pit or hole (default off).

'autopickup'::
    Automatically pick up things onto which you move (default on).

'autopickup_rules'::
    Automatically pick up things onto which you move (set by submenu).
    Set which things you pick up automatically.  The option-file 
    representation of this is not hand-editable.

'autoquiver'::
    This option controls what happens when you attempt the `f' (fire)
    command with an empty quiver.  When true, the computer will fill
    your quiver with some suitable weapon.  Note that it will not take
    into account the blessed/cursed status, enchantment, damage, or
    quality of the weapon; you are free to manually fill your quiver with
    the `Q' command instead.  If no weapon is found or the option is
    off, the `t' (throw) command is executed instead.  (default off)

'corridorbranch'::
    Branching corridoes do not stop farmove commands (+YUHJKLBN+
    and +_+.) (default on).

'disclose'::
    UI option. Controls disclosure of inventory, possessions, status,
    and other character information when the game ends. Possible
    values are "yes", "no", "ask, default yes", and "ask, default no".

//FIXME: Game should refuse a value matching a reserved one
'fruit'::
    Name a fruit after something you enjoy eating (ex. +fruit=mango+)
    (default +slime mold+). Basically a nostalgic whimsy that
    NetHack uses from time to time.  You should set this to something you
    find more appetizing than slime mold.  Apples, oranges, pears, bananas, and
    melons already exist in NetHack, so don't use those.

'menustyle'::
    Controls the interface used when you need to choose various objects (in
    response to the Drop command, for instance).  The value specified should
    be the first letter of one of the following:  traditional, combination,
    partial, or full.  Traditional was the only interface available for
    earlier versions; it consists of a prompt for object class characters,
    followed by an object-by-object prompt for all items matching the selected
    object class(es).  Combination starts with a prompt for object class(es)
    of interest, but then displays a menu of matching objects rather than
    prompting one-by-one.  Partial skips the object class filtering and
    immediately displays a menu of all objects.  Full displays a menu of
    object classes rather than a character prompt, and then a menu of matching
    objects for selection.

'movecommand'::
    Controls what happens when movement causes you to try to run into a
    monster.  There are a number of possible interaction modes;
    'standard' is the default.  The "items" column in the following
    table tells whether you do autopickup actions on items where you stop,

[align="center",width="30%",frame="topbot",options="header"]

|=============================================================================


'multistage_equip'::
    Equipping items can imply unequipping an item in use. Without this
    option an attempt to equip may fail with a message. Deaults to on.

'packorder'::
    Specify the order to list object types in (default
    ``")[%?+!=/(*`0_''). The value of this option should be a string
    containing the symbols for the various object types.  Any omitted types
    are filled in at the end from the previous order.

'pickup_burden'::
    When you pick up an item that would exceed this encumbrance
    level (unburdened, burdened, stressed, strained, overtaxed,
    or overloaded), you will be asked if you want to continue.
    (Default `stressed').

'pickup_thrown::
    Automatically pick up items you threw or fired when you move over
    them (default on).

'prayconfirm'::
    Prompt for confirmation before praying (default on).

'pushweapon'::
    Using the `w' (wield) command when already wielding
    something pushes the old item into your alternate weapon slot (default
    off).

'show_uncursed'::
    Always show uncursed status, even on fully identified items
    (default off). Without this option, if a fully identified item
    is uncursed the status is omitted.

'showrace'::
    Display yourself as the glyph for your race, rather than the glyph
    for your role (default off).  Note that this setting affects only
    the appearance of the display, not the way the game treats you.

'sortpack'::
    Sort the pack contents by type when displaying inventory (default on).

'sparkle'::
   Display a sparkly effect when a monster (including
   yourself) is hit by an attack to which it is resistant (default
   on).

'tombstone'::
    Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).

'travel_interrupt'::
    Interrupt travel (_) when a hostile is in sight (default on).

// Application of this option is too complex and inconsistent to be documented.
// This is a clue that it should be removed.
'verbose'::
    Provide more commentary during the game (default on).

==== Interface options ==== 

'animation'::
   What to animate. Possibilities are 'everything' (the default),
   'instant', 'interruptible', and 'slow'.  This is an exposed bit of
   internals; behavior is probably better controlled through +sparkle+
   and +runmode+.

'bgbranding'::
    UI option. Use background colors to show hidden stairs and traps
    (default on).

'blink'::
    Show multiple symbols for each location that has, e.g., an
    artifact pile (default is off).

'comment'::
    Add a comment field to your config file.  This has no game
    effect, but has administrative uses in multiplayer tournaments.

'darkgray'::
    Try to show black as dark gray if the terminal allows it (default on).

'extmenu'::
    UI option. Changes the extended commands interface to pop-up a
    menu of available commands.  It is keystroke compatible with the
    traditional interface except that it does not require that you hit
    Enter.  It is implemented only by the tty port (default off), when
    the game has been compiled to support tty graphics.

'floorcolor'::
    UI option. Change the color of the floor to show where you walked
    (default on).

'frame'::
    Draw a frame round the window sections (default on).

'graphics'::
    Set the graphics type for the display.  Options are:

[align="center",width="30%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|==================================================
| a | Text (ASCII only)       | For traditionalists
| b | Unicode                 | The default
| c | DawnHack 16-pixel tiles |
| d | DawnHack 32-pixel tiles |
| e | Slash'EM 16-pixel tiles | 
|==================================================

'hilite_pet'::
    UI option. Visually distinguish pets from similar animals (default on).
    The behavior of this option depends on the type of windowing you use.
    In text windowing, text highlighting or inverse video is often used;
    with tiles, generally displays a heart symbol near pets.

'invweight'::
    Show item weights in the inventory listing (default on).

'keymap'::
    Attempting to set this option goes to a submenu where you can
    change the command keybindings - that is, the mapping from command
    keystrokes to internal commands such as +#kick+, +#loot+, etc..

'menu_headings'::

    and to close dialogues by clicking in the x at the upper right.

'menuborder'::
    Draw a border (frame) around menus.  The frame will incldse an
    'x' which can be clicked to terminate the menu action, equivalent
    to typing ESC.

    by lines; you can set scrolling by pages.

'msgheight::
    Message area height (this is the text message area at the upper
    left on a wide display) defaults to 8 lines.

'msghistory'::
    The number of top line messages to save (and recall with +C-P+)
    (default 256).

=== Configuring NetHack for Play by the Blind ===

NetHack can be set up to use only standard ASCII characters for making
maps of the dungeons. This makes NetHack completely
accessible to the blind who use speech and/or Braille access technologies.
Players will require a good working knowledge of their screen-reader's
review features, and will have to know how to navigate horizontally and
vertically character by character. They will also find the search
capabilities of their screen-readers to be quite valuable.

Be certain to examine this Guidebook before playing so you have an
idea what the screen layout is like. You'll also need to be able to
locate the PC cursor. It is always where your character is
located. Merely searching for an @-sign will not always find your
character since there are other humanoids represented by the same
sign. Your screen-reader should also have a function which gives you
the row and column of your review cursor and the PC cursor.  These
co-ordinates are often useful in giving players a better sense of the
overall location of items on the screen.

While it is not difficult for experienced users to set graphics options
file to accomplish this, novices may find this task somewhat daunting.

The most imortant options are:

'menustyle=traditional'::
    This will assist in the interface to speech synthesizers.

Others are in flux, as the options for the display subsystem are
currently being rewritten.

== Scoring ==

NetHack maintains a list of the top scores or scorers on your machine,
depending on how it is set up.  In the latter case, each account on
the machine can post only one non-winning score on this list.  If
you score higher than someone else on this list, or better your
previous score, you will be inserted in the proper place under your
current name.  How many scores are kept can also be set up when
NetHack is compiled.

Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how
much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game
ended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of your gold intact.
If, however, you get killed in the Mazes of Menace, the guild will
only hear about 90\,\% of your gold when your corpse is discovered
(adventurers have been known to collect finder's fees).  So, consider
whether you want to take one last hit at that monster and possibly
live, or quit and stop with whatever you have.  If you quit, you keep
all your gold, but if you swing and live, you might find more.

== Explore mode ==

NetHack is an intricate and difficult game.  Novices might falter
in fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive.  Well, fear
not.  Your dungeon may come equipped with an ``explore'' or ``discovery''
mode that enables you to keep old save files and cheat death, at the
paltry cost of not getting on the high score list.

To enable explore mode, One is to start the game with the +-X+ switch.
Or, you can select "explore" from the menu of birth options.

The other benefits of explore mode are left for the trepid reader to
discover.

== History and Credits ==

This manual describes nethack4, a conservative fork of nethack 3.x.

=== Hack and ancient NetHack ==

The original 'hack' game was modeled on the Berkeley Unix 'rogue'
game.  Large portions of this manual were origninally cribbed from 'A
Guide to the Dungeons of Doom' (describing 'rogue'), by Michael C. Toy
and Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold.  Small portions were adapted from
'Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom', by Ken Arromdee. Most
of this manual has since been heavily modified.

NetHack is the product of literally dozens of people's work.
Main events in the course of the game development are described below:

'Jay Fenlason' wrote the original 'Hack' with help from
'Kenny Woodland', 'Mike Thome', and 'Jon Payne'.

'Andries Brouwer' did a major re-write in 1984, transforming 'Hack' into a
very different game, and published (at least) three versions
(1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for UNIX machines to the Usenet.

'Don G. Kneller' ported 'Hack' 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and MS-DOS,
producing 'PC Hack' 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in
version 1.03g, and went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2,
3.51, and 3.6).

'R. Black' ported 'PC Hack' 3.51 to Lattice C and the Atari
520/1040ST, producing 'ST Hack' 1.03.

'Mike Stephenson' merged these various versions back together,
incorporating many of the added features, and produced NetHack version
1.4.  He then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and
debugging NetHack 1.4 and released NetHack versions 2.2 in December
1987 and 2.3 in April 1988.

=== NetHack 3.x ===

Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
included 'Ken Arromdee', 'Jean-Christophe Collet', 'Steve Creps',
'Eric Hendrickson', 'Izchak Miller', 'Eric S. Raymond', 'John
Rupley', 'Mike Threepoint', and 'Janet Walz', to produce
NetHack 3.0 in August 1989.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by 'Eric R. Smith', to OS/2 by
'Timo Hakulinen', and to VMS by 'David Gentzel'.  The three of them
and 'Kevin Darcy' later joined the main development team to produce
subsequent revisions of 3.0.

'Olaf Seibert' ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.
'Norm Meluch', 'Stephen Spackman' and 'Pierre Martineau' designed
overlay code for 'PC NetHack' 3.0.  'Johnny Lee' ported
NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other Dungeoneers, they
continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports through the later
revisions of 3.0.

Headed by 'Mike Stephenson' and coordinated by 'Izchak Miller' and
'Janet Walz', the development team which now included 'Ken
Arromdee', 'David Cohrs', 'Jean-Christophe Collet', 'Kevin Darcy',
'Matt Day', 'Timo Hakulinen', 'Steve Linhart', 'Dean Luick', 'Pat
Rankin', 'Eric Raymond', and 'Eric Smith' undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote
major parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new
display, special individual character quests, a new endgame and many
other new features, and produced NetHack 3.1 in January 1993.

'Ken Lorber', 'Gregg Wonderly' and 'Greg Olson', with help
from 'Richard Addison', 'Mike Passaretti', and 'Olaf Seibert',
developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

'Norm Meluch' and 'Kevin Smolkowski', with help from
'Carl Schelin', 'Stephen Spackman', 'Steve VanDevender',
and 'Paul Winner', ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

'Jon W\{tte' and 'Hao-yang Wang',
with help from 'Ross Brown', 'Mike Engber', 'David Hairston',
'Michael Hamel', 'Jonathan Handler', 'Johnny Lee',
'Tim Lennan', 'Rob Menke', and 'Andy Swanson',
 developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for MPW.
 Building on their development, 'Barton House' added a Think C port.

'Timo Hakulinen' ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  'Eric Smith' ported
NetHack 3.1 to the Atari.  'Pat Rankin', with help from 'Joshua
Delahunty', was responsible for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.
'Michael Allison' ported NetHack 3.1 to Windows NT.

'Dean Luick', with help from 'David Cohrs', developed NetHack 3.1 for
X11.  'Warwick Allison' wrote a tiled version of NetHack for the
Atari; he later contributed the tiles to the DevTeam and tile support
was then added to other platforms.

The 3.2 development team, comprised of 'Michael Allison', 'Ken
Arromdee', 'David Cohrs', 'Jessie Collet', 'Steve Creps', {\it Kevin
Darcy}, 'Timo Hakulinen', 'Steve Linhart', 'Dean Luick', 'Pat Rankin',
'Eric Smith', 'Mike Stephenson', 'Janet Walz', and 'Paul Winner',
released version 3.2 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the
development team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all
thirteen members of the original development team remained on the team
at the start of work on that release.  During the interval between the
release of 3.1.3 and 3.2, one of the founding members of the
development team, 'Dr. Izchak Miller', was diagnosed with cancer and
passed away.  That release of the game was dedicated to him by the
development and porting teams.

During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of the
game added their own modifications to the game and made these
``variants'' publicly

'Tom Proudfoot' and 'Yuval Oren' created 'NetHack++',
which was quickly renamed 'NetHack--'.
Working independently, 'Stephen White' wrote 'NetHack Plus'.
'Tom Proudfoot' later merged 'NetHack Plus'
and his own 'NetHack$--$' to produce 'SLASH'.
'Larry Stewart-Zerba' and 'Warwick Allison' improved the spell
casting system with the Wizard Patch.
'Warwick Allison' also ported NetHack to use the Qt interface.

'Warren Cheung' combined 'SLASH' with the Wizard Patch to produce
'Slash'em', and with the help of 'Kevin Hugo', added more features.
Kevin later joined the DevTeam and incorporated the best of these
ideas into NetHack 3.3.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.

The 3.3 development team, consisting of 'Michael Allison', 'Ken Arromdee', 
'David Cohrs', 'Jessie Collet', 'Steve Creps', 'Kevin Darcy', 
'Timo Hakulinen', 'Kevin Hugo', 'Steve Linhart', 'Ken Lorber', 
'Dean Luick', 'Pat Rankin', 'Eric Smith', 'Mike Stephenson', 
'Janet Walz', and 'Paul Winner', released 3.3.0 in 
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate race 
and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race, 
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in 
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined 
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues, Samurai, 
Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first version
to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a publicly 
available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.  Despite 
that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last for
more than a year and a half.

The 3.4 development team initially consisted of 
'Michael Allison', 'Ken Arromdee',
'David Cohrs', 'Jessie Collet', 'Kevin Hugo', 'Ken Lorber',
'Dean Luick', 'Pat Rankin', 'Mike Stephenson', 
'Janet Walz', and 'Paul Winner', with ' Warwick Allison' joining 
just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack
runs on:

'Pat Rankin' maintained 3.4 for VMS.

'Michael Allison' maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
'Paul Winner' and 'Yitzhak Sapir' provided encouragement.

'Dean Luick', 'Mark Modrall', and 'Kevin Hugo' maintained and
enhanced the Macintosh port of 3.4.

'Michael Allison', 'David Cohrs', 'Alex Kompel', 'Dion Nicolaas', and 
'Yitzhak Sapir' maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform.
'Alex Kompel' contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port. 
'Alex Kompel' also contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

'Ron Van Iwaarden' maintained 3.4 for OS/2.

'Janne Salmijarvi' and 'Teemu Suikki' maintained
and enhanced the Amiga port of 3.4 after 'Janne Salmij\"{a'rvi} resurrected
it for 3.3.1.

'Christian ``Marvin'' Bressler' maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

The last 3.x release, 3.4.3, shipped in 2003.

There is a NetHack web site devoted to the 3.x versions maintained by
'Ken Lorber' at http://www.nethack.org/.

=== Nethack4 ===

The nethack4 project was begun by Alex Smith, aka ais523, in 2012.  At
that time there had been no nethack 3.x release in nine years (now
eleven years at time of writing in 2014).

The aim of the project was to clean up the 3.x code and improve on it
user interface, merging in ideas from nethack forks including AceHack
and NitroHack.  In 2014 the nethack4 fork remains conservative, with
no gameplay changes other than eliminating bugs and interface gotchas.

A few gotcha-removal changes seem worth mentioning here. Amnesia no
longer removes map information the player could have written down;
instead it drains skill points. Floating eyes cannot be meleed unless
you have gaze protection. Tamed monsters no longer attack un-angered
peaceful monsters. The eat command warns on attempts to eat dangeros
food. Findic a mimic via search no longer wakes it. Recently created
comestibles can no longer be rotten. Nurses now consistently treat
characters holding nonweapons as being unarmed.  The +a+ command no
longer breaks wands, reducing the chance of dolorous typos. Walking
into an always-peaceful monster will chat to them rather than atacking
them, unless an `F` prefix is given.

//FIXME: List other nethack4 devs here

Eric S. Raymond joined the effort in 2014 and produced this revision
of the manual, updating his original from the 1980s.

=== Other Contributors ===

//This list dates from 3.x.x and is people who contributed before 2003
 
From time to time, some depraved individual out there in netland sends a
