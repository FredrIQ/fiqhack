Here's how to get NetHack4 up and running on your machine!

Install libjansson if you don't have it already
Install libncursesw (if you're a roguelike player you probably have it)
Install postgresql (plus pgcrypto, which is probably in a separate package)

use the createdb command to make a new database:
	su postgres
	createdb NetHack4
	createuser -DPRS nh4server
	echo 'CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto' | psql -d NetHack4
You'll be prompted for a password for the functional user.


Now.  The cmake build doesn't seem to work with the default configuration, so we'll use aimake to make our lives easier.  From the project root, do the following (assuming you want to install into the given directory):
	NH4_HOME=/home/greyknight/nethack4
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../aimake -i ${NH4_HOME} ..

Build okay?  Great!  Now we must create a configuration file so that nethack knows how to start up the server.  Create ${NH4_HOME}/etc/nethack4.conf with the following contents:
	dbhost=127.0.0.1
	dbport=5432
	dbuser=nh4server
	dbpass=(** the password you specified earlier **)
	dbname=NetHack4
The password's in plaintext in this file, so you may want to make the file unreadable to others if using this for real.


Let's have a try!  Start up the server (it will daemonize itself):
	${NH4_HOME}/bin/nethack4-server

and start the client:
	${NH4_HOME}/bin/nethack4

Now you should be able to connect to the server running on localhost with the menu option.
