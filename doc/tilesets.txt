The tiles code in this directory was originally taken from Slash'EM, and has
been modified by Alex Smith for use in NetHack 4.  (This documentation file
itself is loosely based on the tiles documentation from Slash'EM.)  The tiles
themselves are distributed in a text format with routines to help in
converting them to a system's preferred format and using them there.  For
information on the authorship of the tiles, see the "copyright" file in the
root of the NetHack 4 distribution.


The Tiles System in NetHack 4
=============================

NetHack 4 uses two formats for tile files; a text format (described below),
and an image format.  (There are also "map files" that record the order of
tiles within an image, necessary to be able to convert the image files back to
text format; and a "catalogue file" `CATALOG.txt` that records which tile
files make up which tilesets.)  The "source code" for tiles is stored in a
number of separate files in text format; during the build, these are converted
into combined text files (still in the text format, but which act like object
code) that contain all the tiles in the tileset in the order in which the
windowport wants them, and then to images for use by the windowports.

As such, it will necessarily lose information to edit the generated output
images; if you want to edit the tilesets, use the tile manipulation utilities
provided.


Tile Manipulation Utilities
---------------------------

    import_tileset    Creates a .txt tileset from a PNG image and a map
    convert_tileset   Reorders and/or combines .txt tilesets based on a map
    export_tileset    Creates PNG images from .txt tilesets
    map_from_tileset  Creates a map file based on a .txt tileset
    build_tilesets    Runs {convert,export}_tileset based on CATALOG.txt

To import a tileset image designed for an old version or another variant, use
`import_tileset` with the appropriate map for that version/variant.  (Maps
appropriate for Slash'EM 0.0.7E7F3 and NetHack 3.4.3 ship with the NetHack 4
source, and a map appropriate for the current version will be generated when
you build NetHack 4.)  If you have a .txt tileset for another version or
variant, you may be able to use it directly, but most likely some of the tiles
will have to be renamed (because older versions have a lot of naming clashes
in their tiles, and there is only so much that the tile handling tools can do
to resolve them).  Probably the biggest change in tile names is on tiles for
objects; randomized-appearance objects will need their tiles renamed to
contain the object class, e.g. "orange potion", "orange spellbook", "orange
gem"; there are five tiles named "orange" in Slash'EM's objects.txt, for
instance (counting both gems with the "orange" appearance and the fruit), and
automatically disambiguating would be very difficult (or even impossible)
because of the risk that other variants add other orange objects (orange
rings? orange wands?).  Once you've imported your tileset, you can either make
it into a tileset image suitable for NetHack 4 by hand using `convert_tileset`
and `export_tileset`, or more conveniently, you can add it to CATALOG.txt an
use `build_tilesets` to create the tileset image.

To edit .txt tile files, you can edit them directly in the .txt file, but if
you want to use an image editor, extract a map from them using
`map_from_tileset`, then export the tileset with `export_tileset`, edit the
resulting .png file, and import it again using the map you extracted from it.
This will keep the tiles in the same order, with the same names.

To add new tiles to the game (because the game was changed in a way that
causes it to display new tiles), you can either edit an existing .txt file, or
add a new one.  (The .txt files are organized by provenance, i.e. which
variant they were imported from, and/or who wrote them.  Adding a new file is
thus reasonable if you haven't created tiles for NetHack 4 before.)  The new
tiles will also need to be added to the catalog (unless you edited a file that
was in the catalog already).  Three sizes are needed for each tile (one fore
each of the the three standard tilesets; however, the big and 3D-effect tiles
can be automatically generated from the 16x16 tiles, so it's possible to
create just the 16x16 tile, and add the .txt file it's in to all three
tilesets (with appropriate scaling options).


The .txt Tile Format
--------------------

The tile distribution format for tile images starts with any number of header
comment lines (each of which starts with an exclamation mark, to indicate it
as a header comment line), followed by a palette, which looks like this:

    A = (0, 0, 0)
    ...
    P = (254, 254, 254)

and then each tile has an entry like:

    # tile 0 (name / comment)
    {
      AAAAGHPAAAAACDAA
      AAAFGDEMLOCNAAAA
    ...
    }

Tile sets which require more than 62 colors can use two character color keys,
giving up to 4096 colors.  All keys in any one file must be the same size.
The number after "tile" is arbitrary and ignored; it exists only for
compatibility with ohther variants and older versions of NetHack.  (When
writing .txt tile files, the tile handling code will use consecutive numbers
starting at 0, for ease of reference.)  The comment (and the slash preceding
it) is optional, and also ignored (although the spaces around the slash are
required); in older versions of the code, it was used to specify the
unrandomized appearance of items, but it is obviously a bad idea for two items
with the same randomized appearance to be able to look different.  (As a
backwards compatibility special case, if the name is "cmap", the comment is
used as the name instead.)  The name is what is used to identify the tile.
Tiles with unrecognised names are permitted, but ignored (thus, tile images
that are currently not used for anything can be stored with images that are).

In order to allow for compatibility with older versions of NetHack, when
running `convert_tileset`, a .txt file that contains multiple tiles with the
same name will have those tiles disambiguated by adding an "s" and a number
starting at 0.  (For instance, if two tiles are called "open door" in a tiles
file, they're interpreted as though they were called "open doors 0" and "open
doors 1".)  The tile-handling code is aware of this convention, and this is
the reason that some tiles have vaguely nondescriptive official names ("walls
4") or ungrammatical names ("Amulet of Yendors 0").  The idea is to reduce, as
much as possible, the amount of editing required to use .txt tile files from
other variants or older versions.

Transparency is handled using (71, 108, 108) to represent the see-through
parts of tiles, defined in `tilesets/tile_h.in` as `DEFAULT_BACKGROUND`.  This
color was originally chosen so that window interfaces that do not handle
transparency would still look OK.  (This is less of a problem in NetHack 4,
where the vast majority of window interfaces are based on libuncursed, but
could potentially still be relevant in the case of custom interfaces.)

The color (72, 108, 108) should be used instead of (71, 108, 108) when an
opaque color is required, for example in the standard 32x32 floor tiles.
Tools that handle tilesets should know the difference and not merge these two
colors together, or indeed, should not remap any other color to (71, 108,
108).

The 16x16 tilesets in older versions of NetHack (and other variants, such as
Slash'EM) did not respect this transparency rule, and used (71, 108, 108) as a
solid color, with the windowports special-casing this size of tile.  NetHack 4
avoids this problem via editing the 16x16 tiles to use (72, 108, 108) instead;
you may need to perform the same edit when importing 16x16 tiles from other
variants.


Other Files Used With Tilesets
------------------------------

The text-based tile files are converted into image-based tile files for use by
the tiles code, via placing all the tiles in the same image in a standard
order.  Unlike in older versions of NetHack (in which the drawing code dealt
with tiles directly, and thus knew the sequence they were in), a tile image is
only meaningful in combination with a "map" file that specifies which parts of
the image refer to which files.  A map file for NetHack 4 is generated during
the build, and compiled into the code; map files for other variants and
versions, such as NetHack 3.4.3 and Slash'EM, are provided so that tilesets
from those variants and versions can be imported.  If you want to make your
own NetHack 4 tileset, probably the simplest method is to distribute your
tileset as an image, together with the corresponding map file.  That way, the
`import_tileset` utility can be used to convert your tileset back to text
format (thus, no information is lost), but users with the same version of
NetHack 4 as you will not need to be able to use the tileset handling tools to
be able to play with your tileset.

A tilemap file is just a sequence of tile names, one per line.  (This format
is intentionally incompatible with that used by previous versions, because the
tile names in the maps of previous versions are different from the tile names
in the tile files, making them not particularly useful.)  Unlike with the
text-based format, no name repetition is allowed; all the names must be
unique. The old format had lines starting with "tile" and a number, and
double-quoted the names; this format should be detected and rejected by
tilemap manipulation code.

There is also a catalogue file, `CATALOG.txt`, which specifies which .txt
files make up which tilesets.  This catalogue file is used by the build system
to actually produce the tilesets required.  The `build_tilesets` utility is
used to build the tilesets listed in the catalogue file.

The format of the catalogue file consists of lines that specify which tilesets
to create (as a line with no preceding whitespace and ending with a colon),
and lines whch specify which tile files to make them from (as lines with
preceding whitespace and no colon).  This latter set of lines can also take
command-line options, that are passed to `convert_tileset` (and thus, a
tileset with an unusual background color, or that has tiles of the wrong size,
etc., can be used).  Tiles from files specified later will take precedence
over tiles from files specified earlier.

The `palette.txt` file contains a standard palette of 256 colors (in the same
format as a tileset palette, but without any actual tiles).  Currently all the
tiles, after final merging, only use colors in this palette, even though the
total number of unique colors mentioned in .txt files exceeds 350 (most are
unused, and some are merely off-by-one versions of an existing color).


Tile Rendering
--------------

The various sorts of objects that can have tiles are:

* backgrounds (should be completely opaque in every port)
* traps
* objects
* memory of invisibility
* monsters
* warning symbols
* explosions
* beams (i.e. directional visual effects associated with wands, breath, etc.)
* other visual effects (sparkle, boomerangs, MR, etc.)
* engulfing monsters
* brandings (must always be transparent, even in 16x16)

Every square will always have exactly one background, and can have up to one
of each of the following: traps, objects, object associated monster (e.g. for
statues and corpses); up to one monster or warning symbol; up to one
explosion, beam, or effect; and any number of monster brandings (e.g. to show
that a monster is peaceful) and general brandings (e.g. to show that a door is
known to be unlocked).  When not using a tiles port, brandings are shown using
background or foreground colors (depending on the branding); in tiles ports,
general brandings are superimposed on the background, and monster brandings
are superimposed on the monster.  Warning symbols are encoded as monsters
(with a specific branding to show that they're warnings rather than monsters).


Tile utilities API
------------------

`tile.h` contains shared declarations (and is generated from `tile_h.in` by
the tilemap utility, `tilemap.c`, which is basically a `makedefs` for tiles).
The tilemap utility also generates the default tilemap (`nethack4.map`).

`tiletext.c` defines the external variables from `tile.h` and supplies
the external routines for reading and writing the defined text format.

`tilesequence.{c,h}` calculates which tiles appear in `nethack4.map` and in
which order; `tilesequence.c` uses information from `libnethack` (`drawing.c`)
and about tile names used only by the window ports (`brandings.c`), and
converts between the three formats used for tile names ("API names" used by
the JSON interface, tile names, and tile numbers in the NetHack 4 tilemap for
the current version).  It is not needed by the tile manipulation utilities
(except for `tilemap.c`), because all the information they care about is in
`nethack4.map` already.  However, it is greatly useful to tiles windowports,
because it allows them to determine where on the tiles image the tiles they
need to render are, given the information sent via the API.

NetHack and Slash'EM used to use an array of tiles conversion utilities that
converted between the .txt format and various image formats.  (However, these
are mostly pointless nowadays, unless you want to create a windowport that for
some reason cannot use a .png image for the tiles, in which case you will need
a new export utility.)  If you want to implement one of these, use tiletext.c
and provide code for reading and/or writing another format.  The important
global variables implement a colormap shared between tiletext.c and the other
half of the utilities.  If you want examples, various conversion utilities
(strangely, none of which round-trip; each format can either only be read, or
only be written) exist in the `win/share` folder in Slash'EM's codebase;
NetHack 4 only provides conversion utilities for reading and writing PNG.

The text I/O routines are:

     boolean fopen_text_file(const char *filename, const char *type);
         select file for subsequent tile I/O
         "type" a la fopen
         returns FALSE if file not opened, otherwise reads/writes header
         (including colormap) and sets up to decode/encode tiles
     int fclose_text_file();
         close file
     boolean peek_text_tile_info(ttype, number, name);
         returns FALSE if no next tile in current file
         otherwise fills in the type, number and name of the next tile
     boolean read_text_tile_info(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X], ttype, number, name);
         returns FALSE if no next tile in current file
         otherwise TRUE and insert the tile in the provided array.
         The tile type, number and name are also filled in.
         The application program is responsible for checking these
     boolean read_text_tile(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X]);
         returns FALSE if no next tile in current file
         otherwise TRUE and insert the tile in the provided array.
     boolean write_text_tile_info(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X], ttype, number, name);
         writes tile with supplied type, number and name
     boolean write_text_tile(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X]);
         writes tile
     boolean set_tile_map(const char *filename);
         sets the map that will be used to supply names for tiles (on output)
         or to check that the tiles have the correct names (on input); setting
         this to NULL will disable checking
         returns FALSE on error, TRUE on success

There are two additional shared routines provided for writers:

    void init_colormap();
        initialize the output colormap from the input one
        must be called before opening output file as colormap is part of header
    void merge_colormap();
        merge the current input colormap into the output one

Due to the amount of state being kept, only one text file can be open at a
time.  If you are combining multiple files into one other-format file with a
single common colormap, you may need to open each source file and merge their
colormaps into a common colormap before processing any tiles.

Although there are expected to be only 256 colors in the distribution tiles,
conversion programs should be prepared to accept up to `MAXCOLORMAPSIZE`
colors and map them to a smaller number if their port requires it.  The
preferred set of 256 colors can be found in `palette.txt`.

`tilesequence.c` provides the following three functions:

    int tileno_from_name(const char *name, int offset)
      Given the name of a tile, returns its index within an image file using
      the NetHack 4 tilemap.

    int tileno_from_api_name(const char *name, const char *type, int offset)
      Given the name of an nh_symdef (which might not be the same as the name
      of the corresponding tile; it tends to be a lot shorter), returns its
      index within an image file using the NetHack 4 tilemap. Zaps and
      explosions have a type as well as a name; both are needed to find the
      correct tile.

    const char *name_from_tileno(int tileno)
      Given the index of a tile within an image file (using the NetHack 4
      tilemap), returns the name of that tile. (The return value needs no
      deallocation; it might be a string literal, or might point to a static
      buffer that is overwritten with each call, or might point to a buffer
      that is specific to the input you give. Basically, don't assume it to
      stay valid beyond the next call.)

The "offset" parameter is a value that represents a logically connected range
of tiles (`TILESET_*_OFF`), to make the lookup more efficient, and can be
`TILESEQ_INVALID_OFF` if it is not known in which range the tile resides. The
return value on error is NULL for a pointer, or `TILESEQ_INVALID_OFF` for an
integer.
