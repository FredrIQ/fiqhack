# This is the source file for the "data" file generated by `makedefs -d'. A line
# starting with a # is a comment and is ignored by makedefs.

# This file contains (for the moment) item descriptions. (Expanding it to monster
# descriptions would make sense as well, but they haven't been written yet, nor does
# the code attempt to look for them.)

# The format of the file contains keys (touching the left margin) and descriptions
# corresponding to those keys (each description comes immediately after the key it
# corresponds to, with each line indented via a tab). A key with no description will
# instead copy the description of the key immediately after it (sort of like case 1:
# case 2: in C); wildcards (* and ?) are allowed; starting a key with a tilde instead
# prevents anything that matches that key matching anything on the next line. Keys
# must be lowercase. The file does not actually need to be in alphabetical order, but
# it probably should be in order to be able to edit it more easily.

# When describing an item, the game will give the description matching its
# unidentified description first, whether the item is identified or not. If the item
# is identified, it will additionally give the description matching its identified
# description. Therefore, unidentified descriptions should be written standalone, and
# identified descriptions to follow on from their unidentified counterparts.

agate
	This is one of the least valuable sorts of gemstone, and is not hard enough to
	be able to make scratches in rock.
agate ring
	A small ring with an agate set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
aklys
	It does the same amount of damage as a normal club; about as much as a short
	sword against smaller enemies, but with a large penalty against larger
	enemies, being no better than a dagger in that situation, and even worse than
	an axe.
alchemy smock
	This sort of enchanted smock is highly valued by alchemists, because it
	provides its wearer (but not their equipment) with near-perfect immunity to
	acids and poisons, both of which are occupational hazards for them; it also
	provides minimal protection against blows, and occasionally blocks certain
	types of special attacks used by monsters.
aluminum wand
	A lightweight bar of a mithril-like metal, that can be zapped to release a
	magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
amber
	This material, made from hardened sap, is valued as a gemstone, although
	relatively soft as gemstones go. It is quite valuable, although not as much so
	as all but the cheapest hard gemstones, and less so than a citrine or
	aquamarine.
amethyst
	This soft gemstone is not all that valuable as gemstones go, although it has
	another purpose: it removes the alcohol content of drinks it is dipped into,
	allowing them to be drunk safely without a risk of becoming drunk as a
	result.
amulet of change
	Created as a practical joke by some whimsical wizard, it causes its wearer to
	change from male to female or vice versa; to prevent the victim simply using
	it again to change back, it disintegrates upon causing such a transformation.
amulet of esp
	It allows its wearer to sense nearby minds, giving them an idea of which
	intelligent creatures are nearby; the range of this telepathy is much greater
	if the wearer is blindfolded or otherwise protected from visual distractions.
amulet of life saving
	It prevents the wearer's death or permanent disablement. For instance, it can
	heal lethal wounds, cure deadly diseases, or reverse the transformation of its
	wearer into a statue; but it can avert nearly any other cause of death, too.
	If worn, it activates automatically when its wearer would die. However, the
	strain of saving a life completely destroys the amulet, and recovering from
	the dead makes most creatures permanently slightly less healthy.
amulet of magical breathing
	It acts as an air supply (or a supply of oxygenated water for water-breathing
	wearers), meaning that the wearer can survive even in environments in which
	they could not normally breathe.
amulet of reflection
	It reflects most visible rays and gaze attacks aimed at its wearer, sending
	them back towards the creature that created them.
amulet of restful sleep
	It sometimes, at random, makes its wearer unexpectedly fall into a peaceful
	sleep; comfortable, but potentially dangerous if there are monsters around at
	the time.
amulet of strangulation
	It prevents its wearer breathing, usually leading to a rapid death if it is
	not removed quickly.
amulet of unchanging
	It protects the wearer from effects that would change their form into that of
	a different creature; or, if the wearer is already transformed, prevents them
	turning back. Note that this also prevents a polymorphed body automatically
	turning back to survive a lethal injury, so it should be used with caution.
amulet of yendor
	The mithril amulet desired by even the gods, it is hard to move via magical
	means and even harder to move via divine power, thus requiring a mortal hero
	to rescue it by hand. Even if merely carried, it sometimes gives its owner a
	mental image of the structure of the nearby dungeon, and wearing or holding it
	can occasionally give clues as to the path to the portals leading onwards to
	the homes of the gods.
amulet versus poison
	It completely protects its wearer from the effects of most poisons, including
	naturally poisonous food; but it can do nothing against food that has become
	rotten and tainted through age.
angled poleaxe
	A long pole with an angled axe blade at the end, requiring two hands to
	hold. Its length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent
	enemies, but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
apple
	A small reddish-green fruit, produced by trees that grow in temperate
	climates. It makes a nice snack, but is not all that nutritious; as well as
	being enjoyed by people, it makes a great treat for herbivorous creatures like
	horses.
apron
	A simple but heavily reinforced cloth apron, showing marks of discolouration
	where it has been splashed with all sorts of strange liquids over the years,
	designed to be worn as a cloak above body armor.
arrow
	An iron projectile with a fledged tail and a pointed tip, designed to be fired
	from a bow (throwing it by hand will only do minimal damage). It sometimes
	breaks on impact.
athame
	A special long knife made of iron which works much the same way as a normal
	dagger, with the usual low damage rate, high accuracy, and bonus against
	smaller enemies. However, it is unusually hard, being capable of cutting
	through stone without issues, but unsuited for use as a thrown weapon.
aquamarine
	This hard gem captures the look of being underwater, and is considered
	valuable as a result, about as much so as a citrine stone.
axe
	An iron melee weapon with a broad blade at an angle to its haft, designed for
	chopping, doing more damage than a dagger, but less than a short sword. It has
	a bonus against smaller enemies.
bag
	A small, light and flexible container made of cloth.
bag of holding
	It is possible to store items inside it; this saves backpack space,
	circumventing the normal restriction to 52 carried items. Items in bags are
	also protected from many forms of item-destroying attack. It also magically
	reduces the weight of items stored inside, meaning that more items can be
	carried without causing encumbrance issues, although the weight of the items
	inside will always have some effect.
bag of tricks
	It magically generates monsters; it's possible to reach inside and pull one
	out, although not to put monsters back in the bag. Trying to do this while the
	bag is on the floor will instead result in being bitten; and the bag will
	eventually run out of magical power.
balsa wand
	An unusually light stick of wood, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect,	although only a limited number of times.
bamboo arrow
	A bamboo projectile with a fledged tail and pointed iron tip, designed to be
	fired from a bow (throwing it by hand will only do minimal damage). It
	sometimes breaks on impact.
banana
	A curved yellow fruit that grows on tropical trees; people and herbivorous
	animals alike enjoy the taste of the insides, although the peel is generally
	discarded. It is about as filling as an orange, and noticeably more so than an
	apple.
banded mail
	A suit of body armor made out of overlapping strips of iron, providing
	extremely good protection against attack, almost as good as plate mail and
	equivalent to splint mail, although it cannot block special attacks of
	monsters. Its metallic construction interferes with spellcasting.
bardiche
	It is very powerful, doing slightly more damage against smaller enemies than a
	long sword, but with a huge bonus against larger enemies, against which it is
	as powerful as a two-handed sword, and more powerful than any other weapon.
battle-axe
	It is slightly less effective than a two-handed sword (around twice as
	powerful as a short sword), and has a bonus against large creatures (although
	not quite as large as a two-handed sword's).
beaked polearm
	A polearm with a beaked end, requiring two hands to hold. Its length prevents
	it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies, but it can be used
	to attack enemies slightly further away.
beartrap
	A hinged iron device with a powerful spring and sharp teeth. Although it is
	currently disarmed, if set correctly it will trap monsters that step on it,
	holding them in place for a while.
bec de corbin
	It is about as effective as a short sword, except that its bonus is against
	smaller rather than larger enemies, much the same as a battle-axe.
bell
	A small brass device with a clapper, that makes a ringing noise when
	shaken. It alerts nearby monsters to your location, meaning that it can be
	used to tell your pets where you are; although it makes a poor instrument, as
	it can only play one note.
bell of opening
	Its magical sound can reveal nearby hidden objects, like secret doors and
	traps, and even unlock and open nearby doors and containers if powered up by
	additional holy energy, although it can only be used a very few times before
	it needs to be magically recharged. Its sound is also one of the keys to
	unlocking a special vibrating magical door.
bill-guisarme
	It is more powerful than a typical short sword, and around as powerful as a
	broadsword against smaller enemies, but not as powerful as a long sword. It
	has a small bonus against larger enemies.
black dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	black dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	protects its wearer from disintegration attacks.
*black dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a black dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also protects its wearer from disintegration attacks.
black gem
	A black object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
black onyx ring
	A small ring with a black onyx set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
black opal
	It is hard, and considered very valuable, about as much so as an emerald and
	much more so than a normal opal.
black potion
	A glass vial containing black liquid that seems to suck light out of the air
	around it.
blindfold
	A piece of cloth that can be wrapped around the head, blocking out light and
	blinding its user; it protects against attacks that have to be seen to
	function.
blue and green shield
	A large wooden shield dyed in shades of cyan, designed to be held in the
	offhand; it sometimes deflects attacks, more so than a small shield would.
	Holding a shield makes it harder to do the gestures associated with
	spellcasting, no matter what material it is made from.
blue dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	blue dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	gives almost perfect protection from the effects of electricity and lightning,
	although it protects only the wearer, not his or her equipment.
*blue dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a blue dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also gives almost perfect protection from the effects of
	electricity and lightning, although it protects only the wearer, not his or
	her equipment.
blue gem
	A blue object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
book of the dead
	The words in this dreaded book are one of the keys to unlocking a special
	vibrating magical door; all that is needed is to read them aloud, but only if
	the door is bathed in a special magical light, and still ringing with the
	echoes of a special magical sound. Reading it at other times can open a
	strange and dangerous connection to undeath.
boomerang
	A curved piece of wood, designed to be thrown by hand as a projectile. It
	deals more damage than any single other thrown weapon, and can even sometimes
	return to its user given enough space, but follows a curved path and sometimes
	breaks on impact.
boulder
	A huge chunk of rock. It could make for a very powerful weapon, except that it
	looks very unlikely that a normal-sized person could lift it, or even climb
	over or around it. Most likely, you'll just have to settle for pushing it out
	of your way, or squeezing past it.
bow
	A piece of string with both ends connected to a curved piece of wood; wielding
	a bow allows arrows to be fired rather than thrown. Bashing monsters with a
	bow does not do much damage.
brass lantern
	A brass container with glass panels and a light glowing inside, that can be
	turned on and off. It is powered by a stored reservoir of lightning energy,
	which will last approximately three times as long as a wax candle would, but
	which will run out eventually and which can only be recharged by magical
	means.
brass ring
	A piece of brass bent into a circle, designed to be worn on a finger.
brass wand
	A resonant bar of brass, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
brilliant blue potion
	A glass vial containing a brightly glowing blue liquid.
broad pick
	An oversized iron pick-axe, requiring two hands to hold.
broad short sword
	An iron melee weapon with a moderately long, and unusually wide, blade,
	well-balanced for use as an off-hand weapon.
broadsword
	An iron sword with a wide slashing blade. It is about as powerful as a short
	sword against larger enemies, but has a bonus against smaller enemies.
bronze plate mail
	A suit of body armour made out of plates of bronze connected by hinges,
	reinforced to provide extremely good levels of protection against attack,
	about as good as splint mail (but not quite as good as iron plate
	mail). Making armour out of bronze makes it immune to rust, although its
	metallic nature still interferes with spellcasting, and it does not provide
	protection from special attacks the same way other plate mail does.
bronze ring
	A piece of bronze bent into a circle, designed to be worn on a finger.
bronze spellbook
	A book, its bronzed metal covers needing considerable force to open. Reading
	it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
brown potion
	A glass vial containing an ugly brown liquid.
bubbly potion
	A glass vial containing a white froth made out of bubbles.
*buckled boots
	Stylish boots with an ornate buckle.
bugle
	A long horn made of brass, which can be blown into to play music; the note
	played depends on how hard you blow. Bugles are also used by soldiers to
	communicate; one blast of a bugle can change an entire army from lazing around
	waiting to getting ready for battle.
bullwhip
	A leather whip, which can theoretically be used as a melee weapon, but which
	does less damage even than most items not intended as weapons, and no damage
	at all against particularly thick-skinned monsters. It can, however, wrap
	itself around items on the ground or held by a monster, and maybe even pull
	them towards you.
c-ration
	The Yendorian army only get to eat two meals a day; when a soldier steps out
	of line, which happens surprisingly often, they are punished by being given
	C-rations for that day rather than the more standard K-rations, which are very
	similar but made of lower-quality food, and so somewhat less nutritious, about
	three-quarters as much as a K-ration (which translates to a little over one
	third of a food ration, or around six apples).
can of grease
	This steel container can be used to pour a thick layer of grease onto an item,
	giving it temporary protection from rust, rotting and corrosion, but in some
	cases making it harder to hold. It only holds a finite amount of grease,
	though; the only plausible way to refill it deep in a dungeon is via magical
	means.
candelabrum
	A decorative gold construction with space to hold up to seven candles, giving
	off a strong and palpable magical aura.
candelabrum of invocation
	When all seven candles are added to it and lit, it gives off a special magical
	light that is one of the keys to unlocking a special vibrating magical door.
candle
	A small but stout white stick of burnable material. When lit, it burns slowly,
	giving off a dim light for a while; lighting a sufficiently large number of
	candles at once will make the light brighter.
candy bar
	A bar made by forming sugar, milk and other delicious (but not particularly
	healthy) ingredients into the sort of food that people eat for a treat. Its
	high sugar content makes it around as filling as two apples would be.
carrot
	An orange vegetable that grows a few inches underground; it can be eaten raw,
	enjoyed by people and herbivorous animals, and particularly loved as a treat
	by horses. It is rumoured to help with problems with eyesight, and is about as
	filling as an apple.
chain mail
	A good-quality flexible armoured shirt made out of a large number of tiny
	linked rings of iron, providing very good protection against attack, better
	than scale or ring mail, although not as good as splint mail, and sometimes
	(although not very often) blocking some types of special attack used by
	monsters. Its metal construction interferes with spellcasting.
cheap plastic imitation of the amulet of yendor
	You feel that something is not right with this amulet, though; on closer
	inspection, it appears to not be the real Amulet of Yendor, but rather a badly
	manufactured plastic fake.
chest
	A very heavy reinforced wooden box that can be locked, designed to have items
	stored inside it.
chrysoberyl
	It is considered somewhat valuable as a gemstone, about as much so as a
	typical garnet; it is not hard enough to make scratches in rock.
circular amulet
	A mysterious iron circle, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
citrine
	The unusual color of this soft gemstone makes it valuable, about as much so as
	an aquamarine stone, and more so than all but the most valuable soft gems.
clay ring
	A piece of fired clay in the shape of a circle, designed to be worn on a
	finger.
clear potion
	A glass vial containing liquid that is as clear as water.
cloak of displacement
	In addition to providing minimal protection from attack, and blocking many
	sorts of special attacks used by monsters with a good success rate, it also
	makes the wearer appear to be in a different location to the location they are
	actually in, causing many enemies to attack in the wrong direction until they
	figure out where the wearer actually is.
cloak of invisibility
	While worn, it makes both the wearer and their carried and worn equipment
	invisible, making most creatures incapable of seeing them. It also provides
	minimal protection to the body from attack, and blocks some types of special
	attacks used by monsters with a good success rate.
cloak of magic resistance
	In addition to providing minimal protection from attack, it also provides
	almost perfect protection both from many types of special attacks used by
	monsters, and from a wide range of magical attacks that do not damage
	directly, in addition to damage that would be caused directly by magical
	energy (rather than, say, fire or lightning created by a magical source).
cloak of protection
	It has a powerful repelling aura placed on it, providing moderately good
	protection from attack (in addition to any protection from body armour), and
	almost perfect protection from certain types of special attacks used by
	monsters.
cloth spellbook
	A book, carefully bound with an unusual cloth cover. Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
cloudy potion
	A glass vial containing some liquid and a lot of white vapour.
clove of garlic
	A herb mostly used for giving flavour to food; vampires are rumoured to be
	particularly afraid of its scent. It can be eaten as food, but is not
	particularly filling, slightly less so than an apple.
club
	A short heavy piece of wood designed for bludgeoning enemies in melee. It is
	about as effective as a short sword against smaller enemies, but instead of a
	bonus against larger enemies, it has a large penalty, being no better than a
	dagger in that situation, and even worse than an axe.
coarse mantelet
	A cloak coarsely made of blackened cloth, designed to be worn above body
	armour.
*combat boots
	Boots in a style commonly worn by soldiers.
concave amulet
	An irregularly shaped and weirdly dented piece of iron, connected to a chain
	so that it can be worn around a person's neck.
conical hat
	A cone-shaped cloth hat.
copper ring
	A decorative circle of copper, designed to be worn on a finger.
copper spellbook
	A book, bound in carved yet tarnishing copper. Reading it is dangerous, but a
	sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
copper wand
	Some springy strands of copper woven into a much thicker wire, that can be
	zapped to release a magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
coral ring
	A circular piece of coral, designed to be worn on a finger.
cornuthaum
	Despite providing no real protection for the head, it can block many special
	attacks of monsters with a good success rate. It helps focus the mental powers
	of wizards, making their natural arrogance more effective and occasionally
	giving them a sense of the surrounding area; but only wizards can pull this
	feat off, with other classes merely looking stupid wearing such a hat.
*corpse
	A dead monster. The bodies of monsters can always be eaten, but eating the
	wrong sort of monster might be dangerous or even fatal; on the other hand,
	some corpses are very beneficial to eat. Corpses tend to spoil over time,
	becoming lethally tainted; thus, bodies of monsters that died a long time ago
	should not be eaten, whether because they were not freshly killed, or because
	they were undead and killed a second time.
cram ration
	The standard sort of ration carried by rangers when going on long journeys,
	cram is a sort of staple crop that keeps excellently and is somewhat
	nutritious, although rather bland. It is around three-quarters as nutritious
	as a typical food ration would be, or about as filling as twelve apples.
cream pie
	A hilarious foodstuff used as a projectile by clowns to blind their opponents
	in an amusing manner. If instead it is eaten, it is around as filling as two
	apples would be.
credit card
	A small rectangle of plastic, marketed by banks as a method of paying for
	items without carrying cash. Unfortunately, shops deep in dungeons tend not to
	be connected to international monetary credit card networks, and wouldn't
	trust the card to be valid in any case, but maybe the physical properties of
	the card would come in useful for wedging open locks.
crested helmet
	An iron helmet with an impressive crest.
crossbow
	A mechanical contrivance designed to fire crossbow bolts, with a string under
	tension that can be wound back slowly and then released; wielding a crossbow
	allows crossbow bolts to be fired rather than thrown. Bashing monsters with a
	crossbow does not do much damage.
crossbow bolt
	A thick iron quarrel with a sharpened point, designed to be fired from a
	crossbow (throwing it by hand will only do minimal damage). It sometimes
	breaks on impact. Crossbows tend to do less damage than ordinary bows, though.
crude arrow
	A blackened iron projectile with a badly fledged tail and a pointed but
	crooked tip, designed to be fired from a bow (throwing it by hand will only do
	minimal damage). It sometimes breaks on impact.
crude bow
	A piece of string with both ends connected to a crudely curved piece of
	blackened wood; wielding a bow allows arrows to be fired rather than
	thrown. Bashing monsters with a bow does not do much damage.
crude chain mail
	A flexible armoured shirt made out of a large number of tiny linked rings of
	blackened iron, although made rather crudely; due to being made of metal, it
	interferes with spellcasting.
crude dagger
	A long knife or very short sword crudely made of blackened iron, which can be
	used as a melee weapon, or thrown by hand (with an unusually high rate of fire
	for skilled users).
crude ring mail
	A low-quality flexible shirt crudely made by linking rings of blackened iron,
	whose metallic nature interferes with spellcasting.
crude short sword
	A crude melee weapon with a moderately long blade made of blackened iron,
	well-balanced for use as an off-hand weapon.
crude spear
	A moderately long piece of crude blackened iron, sharpened to a point. It can
	be thrown by hand or used as a melee weapon.
crysknife
	A tooth taken from a dead worm and then magically enchanted to have a very
	sharp cutting edge, working like a knife, but an unusually effective one,
	being better than most swords (dealing more damage than a long sword to small
	enemies, but without the bonus against larger enemies), and more accurate than
	any other weapon. It needs constant exposure to the body of a living creature
	to maintain the enchantment, though.
crystal ball
	Staring into a crystal ball for a long period of time might allow its user to
	pinpoint various features around them, such as the location of traps; but
	doing so may backfire on less intelligent users. They also eventually run out
	of magic after enough use, and require magical means to restore it.
crystal plate mail
	A suit of body armour made out of plates of glass connected by hinges,
	reinforced to provide incredibly good levels of protection against attack,
	working just as well as its iron equivalent, but without causing spellcasters
	any problems. It also blocks many special attacks of monsters with a good
	success rate; however, its glass construction is incredibly heavy.
crystal wand
	A cylinder of the purest sparkling glass, that can be zapped to release a
	magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
curved sword
	An iron melee weapon with a curved slashing blade.
curved wand
	An oddly misshapen magical wand, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
cyan potion
	A glass vial containing a bright greenish-blue liquid.
cyan spellbook
	A book, with covers showing a picture of the sky; somehow, clouds move across
	them now and again. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader
	can learn a spell from it.
dagger
	A long knife or very short sword made of iron, which can be used as a melee
	weapon, or thrown by hand (with an unusually high rate of fire for skilled
	users). It does not do much damage (slightly more than a dart, and much less
	than a typical short sword), but is very accurate, and is better against
	smaller enemies.
dark blue spellbook
	A book, whose covers seem to be made out of some sort of denim riveted to the
	pages. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a
	spell from it.
dark brown spellbook
	A book, covered in rough bark. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently
	skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
dark green potion
	A glass vial containing an ominous dark green liquid.
dark green spellbook
	A book, with dark green yet highly reflective covers. Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
dark potion
	A glass vial containing liquid that seems to be in constant shadow.
dart
	A short iron projectile with a pointed tip and fledged tail, designed to be
	thrown by hand, although it is not very effective at damaging monsters. It
	sometimes breaks on impact.
dented pot
	An iron helmet that's worse for wear due to all the damage it's taken over the
	years. Nowadays, it only provides minimal protection to the head, although it
	will turn aside many falling objects; also, note that its metallic nature
	interferes with spellcasting.
diamond
	This gem is famous for its hardness; although not shaped to be useful as a
	weapon, it is not damaged at all by scratching into even solid rock. It is
	also considered one of the most valuable gems in existence, and worth more
	than almost any other gem.
diamond ring
	A small ring with a diamond set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
dilithium crystal
	This gem is incredibly valuable (more so than any other), although relatively
	soft. It resembles nothing else seen in the world; although it theoretically
	has several scientific uses, they require specialised equipment not found in a
	dungeon, so its only use to an adventurer is its value.
dog eared spellbook
	A book, whose pages are dirty, as if it has been read many times. Reading it
	is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
double-headed axe
	An iron melee weapon with two broad blades at angles to its haft, designed for
	chopping.
drum
	A leather device which can be banged on to make a loud noise; it is sometimes
	used as an accompaniment to an orchestra, but cannot play a tune by itself
	because its notes do not have any particular pitch.
drum of earthquake
	The sound of this drum is magically amplified, causing the entire dungeon to
	vibrate with the sheer volume of the sound, and maybe causing nearby terrain
	to collapse. Monsters might become angry or scared as a result. The powerful
	effect of the drum runs through its magical supplies quickly, being usable
	only a limited number of times before it needs magical recharging; it can
	still be banged on in such a state, just without the amplification.
dull spellbook
	A nondescript book, that seems not to care for light falling on its covers.
	Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell
	from it.
dunce cap
	This nasty cap not only provides no protection to the head or anything else,
	it makes its wearer foolish and stupid.
dusty spellbook
	A book, its covers illegible behind centuries of accumulated dust. Reading it
	is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
dwarvish cloak
	It shows signs of dwarvish manufacture, but is intended for style purposes
	rather than as armour, giving no additional protection to the body; however,
	it blocks certain types of special attacks used by monsters with a good
	success rate.
dwarvish iron helm
	Its high-quality dwarven manufacture provides moderate protection from damage,
	and turns aside many falling objects; however, metallic armour interferes with
	spellcasting.
dwarvish mattock
	It is about as powerful as a long sword, except with a bonus against smaller
	enemies rather than larger enemies; but rather difficult to aim. However, its
	shape means that it can be used to attack rock walls as well as enemies,
	eventually reducing them to a pile of rubble.
dwarvish mithril-coat
	A high-quality coat of armour manufactured from mithril by dwarves; its
	mithril construction makes it immune to rust and corrosion, and very light,
	whilst still providing extremely good protection against attack, as good as
	splint mail and almost as good as plate mail. It covers the entire body,
	providing almost perfect protection from many sorts of special attacks of
	monsters. However, mithril is still a metal and so still blocks spellcasting.
dwarvish roundshield
	Dwarven shields tend to pack just as much protection as human shields into a
	smaller physical size, but are no better or worse in combat.
dwarvish short sword
	Dwarvish manufacture is, as always, slightly better than human manufacture
	when it comes to weapons, although dwarves are not as experienced at
	swordsmithing as elves are, leading to slightly less dangerous swords. It has
	a bonus against larger enemies.
dwarvish spear
	Its dwarvish manufacture is even higher quality than typical elvish
	manufacture; it works as well as a human-manufactured spear or short sword
	against larger enemies, but unusually for spears, it has no problems against
	smaller enemies.
ebony wand
	An unusually black stick of wood, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
effervescent potion
	A glass vial containing gray liquid whose surface is constantly and rapidly
	fizzing.
egg
	A container designed to contain both food for a baby monster and maybe the
	baby itself, laid by some female egg-laying monster. Eggs might be nutritious
	or dangerous to eat, depending on what sort of monster laid them; and over
	time, will either spoil or hatch, depending on whether they were fertilised or
	not. Eggs are not particularly filling, about as filling as an orange (more
	filling than an apple; but only about one tenth as much as a food ration).
elven arrow
	It seems to be of elvish manufacture, designed to avoid the elvish fear of
	metal, and is of a better quality than a typical human-made arrow; elves are
	more deadly with it, and have a better rate of fire, when also using an elven
	bow.
*elven boots
	These minimally protective leather boots are well-crafted by elves to make
	almost no sound when walking, allowing their wearer to sneak past sleeping
	monsters without waking them. As with most armour of elven manufacture, they
	are particularly tolerant of high levels of enchantment.
elven bow
	This bow is of elven manufacture; allegedly it's of higher quality, but only
	elves can tell the difference.
elven broadsword
	This hardened wooden sword was manufactured by some of the best elven
	swordsmiths, making it as good as a broadsword or short sword against larger
	enemies, but with a huge bonus against smaller enemies, against which it is
	better than a long sword or even katana, and almost as good as a two-handed
	sword.
elven cloak
	This sort of cloak is used by elves to help keep their movements silent,
	allowing its wearer to slip past sleeping monsters without waking them; its
	elven construction makes it capable of withstanding high levels of magical
	enchantment. It also provides a minimal level of additional protection to the
	body, and almost perfect protection against certain types of special attacks
	used by monsters.
elven dagger
	Its high-quality elven manufacture makes it do more damage than a typical
	dagger, almost as much as a short sword against smaller enemies, whilst being
	just as accurate, but it is just as bad against larger enemies as a typical
	dagger.
elven leather helm
	A hardened leather hat, reinforced with extra bands of material to work as
	makeshift armour.
elven shield
	The high-quality elven construction of this shield makes it capable of
	withstanding a high level of enchantment.
elven short sword
	Elves are experts at sword manufacture, outdoing even dwarves when it comes to
	making short swords, resulting in a sword that damages larger enemies as well
	as a typical short sword, but does just as well against smaller enemies.
elven spear
	Its high-quality elvish manufacture makes it more effective against smaller
	enemies than a typical spear or short sword (although still not as effective
	as against larger enemies), and just as effective against larger enemies.
elven mithril-coat
	A coat of armour manufactured from mithril by elves; its mithril construction
	makes it immune to rust and corrosion, and very light, whilst still providing
	very good protection against attack, as good as chain mail; elves are unused
	to working with metal, though (because it blocks spellcasting), making it not
	as protective as a dwarvish-made mithril coat would be, although it is
	specifically designed to withstand high levels of magical enchantment. It
	covers the entire body, providing almost perfect protection from many sorts of
	special attacks of monsters.
emerald
	Although not quite as valuable as a ruby or even sapphire, this hard gemstone
	is nonetheless very valuable.
emerald potion
	A glass vial containing an emerald green liquid.
emerald ring
	A small ring with an emerald set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
engagement ring
	A small steel ring with a low-valued gemstone set into it, designed to be worn
	on a finger to demonstrate the love of its wearer.
etched helmet
	An iron helmet with artistic patterns etched into it with acid, leading to an
	elegant effect.
eucalyptus leaf
	The leaf of a eucalyptus plant. It is edible but not particularly filling,
	about half as much as an apple; but can serve as a natural cure for some types
	of sickness or illness.
expensive camera
	An expensive plastic device. The manufacturer considers it a way of taking
	photos to keep a record of your adventure; most adventurers, though, consider
	it a way of producing a blinding flash of light that both dazzles monsters,
	and annoys them. Despite the price tag, it is not particularly robust, and is
	easy to accidentally break with rough handling. Also, it eventually runs out
	of film; deep in a dungeon, the only way to replace it is via magical means.
faded pall
	A cloth cloak, designed to be worn above body armour, with its former colour
	faded so much, perhaps from sunlight, that it's impossible to tell what it
	was.
fauchard
	It is just as powerful as a typical short sword or spear, with a similar bonus
	against larger enemies.
fedora
	A stylish cloth hat, which may look fancy but which is useless at protecting
	the head from anything unless magically enchanted.
*fencing gloves
	The sort of gloves worn by duelists.
figurine
	When placed on the ground in the correct manner, this tiny magical statue
	transforms into a full-sized monster. It's not at all obvious whether the
	newly-created monster will be happy to see you or hostile.
fire horn
	Blowing this magical horn will shoot a powerful beam of flame in a direction
	of your choice, dealing huge amounts of damage to monsters that do not resist
	it. However, this will only work a limited number of times before requiring
	magical recharging. When out of magic, it acts like an ordinary horn.
fizzy potion
	A glass vial containing light blue liquid that constantly forms new bubbles.
flail
	A heavy iron ball attached to a handle by a chain, which can be swung at an
	enemy. It does about as much damage as a scimitar, saber or long sword against
	smaller enemies, but has only a minimal bonus against larger ones.
flint stone
	This ordinary stone made of flint has no magical properties, although it does
	at least make reasonable sling ammunition, and could even be thrown by hand as
	a weapon in emergencies, although it would not do much damage.
fluorite
	This soft gemstone is relatively cheap as gemstones go, although more valuable
	than jade or agate, or many non-gemstone items.
flute
	A wooden tube with holes that can be covered by the fingers; blowing sideways
	across one end and covering different patterns of holes will play different
	musical notes.
food ration
	An entire pre-prepared meal packaged so that it keeps well during long
	journeys, rations are the standard food source used by adventurers, and highly
	nutritious. They are typically made of sandwiches, cereal bars, and other
	similar easily-to-hold food made from cereal crops and vegetables; and form a
	complete meal for the entire day, being about as filling as sixteen apples.
forked polearm
	A very long iron spear with a forked end, requiring two hands to hold. Its
	length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies,
	but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
forked wand
	A magic wand that splits into three points at the end, that can be zapped to
	release a magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
fortune cookie
	A hard biscuit with a slip of paper inside, which might contain useful advice
	but might be useless, or even lying. It is slightly less nutritious than an
	apple, and made from flour, milk and sugar.
frost horn
	Blowing this magical horn will shoot a powerful beam of cold in a direction of
	your choice, dealing huge amounts of damage to monsters that do not resist
	it. However, this will only work a limited number of times before requiring
	magical recharging. When out of magic, it acts like an ordinary horn.
*fumble boots
	These minimally protective leather boots have an insidious enchantment, making
	their wearer occasionally noisily trip, slip, or otherwise fail to walk
	normally.
garnet
	This gemstone is somewhat valuable, a little more so than an amethyst, despite
	not being hard enough to scratch into solid rock.
*gauntlets of dexterity
	These leather gloves make their wearer more adept at aiming, archery,
	accuracy, and similar tasks that need a dexterity or a steady hand; however,
	these benefits are only seen if the gloves are enchanted, with higher
	enchantments giving larger benefits.
*gauntlets of fumbling
	These dubiously enchanted leather gloves make their wearer tend to drop things
	and similarly fumble, although they still provide minimal protection for the
	hands.
*gauntlets of power
	Beneath their unassuming exterior, these gloves are actually gauntlets made of
	iron (and thus interfere with spellcasting); despite providing only minimal
	protection to the hands, they are enchanted to provide an enormous boost to
	strength, making the wearer much stronger than can be achieved without magical
	aid.
glaive
	It is about as powerful as a short sword, but has an even larger bonus against
	larger enemies.
glass orb
	A large and heavy sphere made of glass, with some sort of magical mist
	swirling inside it; it is fragile and easily broken.
glass wand
	A thick cylinder of glass, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
glittering spellbook
	A book, that glitters strangely as if hugely valuable. Reading it is
	dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
gold piece
	The major coin used in the Yendorian economy. Each gold piece is worth 1
	zorkmid.
gold ring
	A glittering circle of gold, designed to be worn on a finger.
gold spellbook
	A book, with pages and cover made from gold leaf. Reading it is dangerous, but
	a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
golden potion
	A glass vial containing liquid that glows with a golden glow.
granite ring
	A circular piece of granite, designed to be worn on a finger.
grappling hook
	It can be used in combat as a makeshift flail, doing minimal damage (less than
	even a dagger) against smaller enemies, but decent damage against larger
	enemies, slightly less than a short sword and about as much as a mace. Its
	major purpose, though, is to grab hold of things at a distance, either to pull
	them towards you, or you towards them; large monsters can be attacked at a
	distance like this. Users with relative familiarity with flail-type weapons
	will be better at this, though, with inexperienced users likely to mess up and
	hurt themselves by mistake.
gray dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	gray dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	protects its wearer from a wide range of magical attacks that do not damage
	directly, as well as damage from pure magic (as opposed to, say, a fireball
	conjured using magic).
*gray dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a gray dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also protects its wearer from a wide range of magical attacks
	that do not damage directly, as well as damage from pure magic (as opposed to,
	say, a fireball conjured using magic).
gray spellbook
	A book, whose cover depicts dismal rainclouds, and even feels rather
	damp. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a
	spell from it.
gray stone
	This roughly spherical gray rock is clearly not valuable as a gemstone.
green dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	green dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	gives its wearer almost perfect protection from the effects of all forms of
	poison.
*green dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a green dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also gives its wearer almost perfect protection from the effects
	of all forms of poison.
green gem
	A green object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
guisarme
	It is as effective as a short sword or spear against larger enemies, but even
	more effective against smaller enemies than it is against larger ones.
halberd
	It does a huge amount of damage, slightly more than a long sword or even
	katana, and is slightly better against larger enemies.
hard hat
	A well-made reinforced iron hat, designed to protect the head from blows.
*hard shoes
	Reinforced shoes made of iron; their metallic nature interferes with
	spellcasting.
harp
	A musical instrument made by stringing many strings onto a wooden frame, each
	with a slightly different length; plucking a different string allows a
	different note to be played.
hawaiian shirt
	A garish and brightly coloured cloth shirt, fitting tightly enough to be worn
	underneath other sorts of armour, although providing no protection to the body
	unless magically enchanted.
heavy iron ball
very heavy iron ball
	This huge ball of iron seems to have been designed to weight something or
	someone down; forcing someone to struggle with such an object would be quite
	the punishment. Its weight would make it a surprisingly good bludgeoning
	weapon, for someone willing to struggle carrying it.
helm of brilliance
	Although this magical helmet provides only minimal protection to the head (in
	addition to protection from falling objects), it enhances the intellect of the
	wearer (to a degree depending on how highly enchanted it is), making
	spellcasting easier. Despite being made of metal, it was designed by mages to
	avoid interfering with spellcasting.
helm of opposite alignment
	Although this insidious helmet provides the same minimal protection to the
	head, protection from falling objects, and problems with spellcasting, as
	pretty much every other iron helmet, it also changes the mental attitude of
	its wearer to a radically different philosophy; people wearing such a helmet
	have been known to suddenly dedicate their lives to different gods, perform
	acts which were once abhorrent to them, and so on. The effect can be reversed
	by removing the helmet, though.
helm of telepathy
	As with other metallic helmets, this one interferes with spellcasting, but it
	aids mental powers another way; it allows the wearer to sense the minds of
	nearby intelligent creatures (with a much greater range if its wearer is
	blindfolded and thus free from visual distractions). It also provides the
	typical minimal protection to the head and protection from falling objects
	that other iron helmets provide.
helmet
	This is an ordinary helmet of human manufacture, designed to protect the head
	from blows; however, it is not as well made as a dwarven helmet would be, and
	provides only minimal protection for the head, although it turns aside many
	falling objects. Its metallic nature interferes with spellcasting.
hexagonal amulet
	An elegant iron hexagon, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
hexagonal wand
	A long and thin hexagonal prism, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
*high boots
	They give the feet a moderate level of protection from attack.
*hiking boots
	Boots designed for supporting the feet on long walks.
hilted polearm
	A very long iron spear with a hilt, requiring two hands to hold. Its length
	prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies, but it
	can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
hooded cloak
	An ordinary cloth cloak with a hood, designed to be worn above body armour.
hooked polearm
	A very long pole with a large sharpened hook at the end, requiring two hands
	to hold. Its length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against
	adjacent enemies, but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
horn
	An imposing musical instrument made out of a hollowed-out bone; it plays
	different notes depending on how hard it is blown into.
horn of plenty
	Rather than making noise, this magical horn makes food; blowing it will either
	produce some non-magical food, or a potion containing some non-magical
	(although not necessarily healthy) liquid. It eventually runs out of magical
	power, though, becoming useless until magically recharged.
huge chunk of meat
	An absolutely enormous chunk of meat; you try to visualise what sort of
	monster it came from, but fail. It is incredibly filling, about as much as two
	and a half food rations.
ice box
	An extremely heavy plastic box that can be locked, whose interior always stays
	magically cold. Although any item that fits in the box can be placed inside
	it, it is designed to store corpses, which do not rot or spoil whilst stored
	in the box (although it has no ability to freshen corpses that are already
	rotten or spoilt).
indigo spellbook
	A book, where every page is an incredible dark purple, with the writing in
	bright green. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
iridium wand
	An iridium bar painted with rainbow colors, that can be zapped to release a
	magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
iron chain
	This length of chain, made of iron, has no obvious beneficial uses to an
	adventurer. It looks like it was designed for punishing a prisoner.
iron hook
	This is an iron hook at the end of an iron chain.
iron wand
	A stick that looks like it was once a bar of a prison cell window, that can be
	zapped to release a magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
iron ring
	A simple circle of iron, designed to be worn on a finger.
*iron shoes
	The solid nature of these shoes gives the feet moderate protection from
	attack.
iron skull cap
	A crude blackened iron cap, designed to protect the head from blows.
ivory ring
	A circle carved from ivory, designed to be worn on a finger.
jacinth
	This gem is extremely valuable (almost as valuable as a ruby, and more than a
	sapphire), and hard enough to scratch into solid rock without damaging itself.
*jackboots
	Knee-high leather boots that cover the entire lower leg.
jade
	Although not hard enough to scratch into rock, and less valuable than most
	other gemstones, it is still worth more than an agate or piece of obsidian.
jade ring
	A small ring with a piece of jade set into it, designed to be worn on a
	finger.
jasper
	This gemstone, although relatively cheap as gemstones go, is still quite
	valuable compared with many other items, and more valuable than fluorite or
	jade. It is not hard enough to scratch into rock.
javelin
	It has a better range than most spears, but does not have the usual bonus
	against larger enemies, making it less effective than a typical spear or short
	sword.
jet
	This relatively soft gemstone is somewhat valuable, more so than most other
	similarly soft gemstones, but less so than all hard gemstones.
jeweled wand
	A stick of corundum, lavishly decorated with much more valuable gems. It can
	be zapped to release a magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
*jumping boots
	These minimally protective leather boots allow the wearer to jump incredibly
	far in a burst of energy, letting them cross small streams or jump over pits
	and similar traps.
*jungle boots
	Boots designed for walking through the muddy soil of a jungle.
k-ration
	The standard-issue food for the Yendorian Army, K-rations are moderately
	nutritious, with two being sufficient for a complete meal (two K-rations are
	around as filling as one food ration, or eight apples), but strictly vegan and
	rather bland.
katana
	It was crafted using secret techniques by the best samurai swordsmiths, making
	it just as good as a typical long sword against large enemies, but better
	against small enemies; and its balance makes it easier to hit with it.
kelp frond
	The leaves of a plant that grows underwater. They are edible, but not
	particularly nutritious, being about half as filling as an apple.
key
	A small piece of iron cut into a specific irregular pattern, designed to be
	recognised by a lock and open it.
*kicking boots
	These minimally protective boots have a hidden hard layer of metal inside,
	allowing their wearer to kick things with huge and magically-enhanced force,
	doing substantial damage to monsters or sending objects flying a surprisingly
	long distance.
knife
	A small but sharp cutting edge made of iron, more suited for cutting up food
	than for combat, although it can be used as a melee weapon or thrown by
	hand. It is not very effective at damaging monsters, but is slightly less bad
	against small enemies than against large ones.
lamp
	A small brass container, often containing flammable liquid. Lighting it causes
	the liquid inside to burn slowly, giving off a moderately bright light for a
	while.
lance
	A long spear-like pole, designed for use when mounted. Its length prevents it
	doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies, except when riding,
	although it can always be used to attack enemies slightly further away; when
	riding, it sometimes shatters on impact. It is about as powerful as a short
	sword, with a similar bonus against larger enemies.
land mine
	A currently-disarmed explosive iron device. When correctly armed, it explodes
	when stepped on, doing a lot of damage and normally taking out a chunk of the
	floor it is placed on.
large box
	A large and heavy wooden box that can be locked, designed to have items stored
	inside it.
large round shield
	A large circular iron shield, designed to be held in the offhand; it sometimes
	deflects attacks, more so than a small shield would. Holding a shield makes it
	harder to do the gestures associated with spellcasting, no matter what
	material it is made from.
large shield
	A large iron shield of human manufacture, designed to be held in the offhand;
	it sometimes deflects attacks, more so than a small shield would. Holding a
	shield makes it harder to do the gestures associated with spellcasting, no
	matter what material it is made from.
leash
	A small noose of leather designed to be tied around the neck of a tame animal,
	in order to stop it running off in the wrong direction.
leather armor
	Body armour made from hardened leather; although only providing moderate
	protection to the body, less than pretty much any sort of metal armour, this
	construction is favoured by spellcasters because it does not interfere with
	their magical works.
leather cloak
	A simple cloak made of leather, designed to be worn above body armour. It
	provides minimal protection against blows, and occasionally blocks certain
	types of special attacks used by monsters.
leather drum
	The loud bang of this non-magical drum might scare nearby monsters into
	running away.
*leather gloves
	These are just ordinary leather gloves, providing minimal protection for the
	hands.
leather hat
	It only provides minimal protection from damage, and no protection from
	falling objects. However, it shows signs of elven manufacture, making it
	particularly capable of withstanding high levels of enchantment.
leather jacket
	An ordinary leather jacket, which could be worn as a substitute for body
	armour but which would only give minimal levels of protection.
leather-bound spellbook
	A book with hardened leather covers, which look like they might once have been
	part of a coat of armour. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled
	reader can learn a spell from it.
lembas wafer
	The elvish take on a food ration, a small but delicious wafer prepared from
	flour and other plant byproducts, with a surprisingly high energy density; one
	wafer can serve as a complete meal. Elves prepare them to a secret recipe
	using organic vegan ingredients. It is about as nutritious as a human-made
	food ration (or sixteen apples), but considerably lighter.
*levitation boots
	These minimally protective leather boots are enchanted to, once worn, lift
	their user into the air until they are removed; although this makes it easy to
	cross water or pass most pits or holes, it makes it impossible to reach the
	ground or go down stairs, meaning that this sort of boot is rarely worn for
	long.
light blue spellbook
	A book, whose covers glow with a dim yet foreboding light blue glow. Reading
	it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
light brown spellbook
	A book with warped balsa-wood covers. Reading it is dangerous, but a
	sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
light green spellbook
	A book, with pictures of a grassy field under a green sky on its covers.
	Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell
	from it.
loadstone
	This hated magical stone is not only exceedinly heavy, but has a tendency to
	curse itself, making it impossible to drop until the curse is lifted.
lock pick
	A small oddly-shaped piece of iron. Those who have some understanding of the
	workings of a lock can use it to fool the lock into opening or closing by
	manipulating the individual levers of the lock, although this takes some time.
long bow
	An unusually long and well-made bow; wielding a bow allows arrows to be fired
	rather than thrown. Bashing monsters with a bow does not do much damage.
long poleaxe
	A very long pole with an axe blade at the end, requiring two hands to
	hold. Its length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent
	enemies, but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
long samurai sword
	A special two-handed katana, one of only a few that exist in the world. It is
	almost twice as powerful as a long sword, and almost three times as powerful
	as a short sword, with a bonus against larger enemies, yet managing to be as
	accurate as a dagger.
long sword
	An iron sword with a very long blade, and one of the best one-handed melee
	weapons in existence. It has a large bonus against larger enemies, but works
	pretty well (better than a short sword and about as well as a scimitar) even
	against smaller enemies.
looking glass
	A small and unusually reflective, although somewhat fragile, piece of glass.
long wand
	A magic wand almost as long as a spear, that can be zapped to release a
	magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
*low boots
	They give only minimal protection for the feet.
lucern hammer
	It is about as effective as a short sword, except that its bonus is against
	smaller rather than larger enemies, much the same as a battle-axe, and it has
	a slightly larger bonus than a battle-axe or bec de corbin.
luckstone
	This stone is enchanted to provide luck to its wearer, making several random
	events give slightly better results on average. In addition, it prevents
	natural luck wearing off over time.
lump of royal jelly
	Food produced by bees to feed baby bee princesses, designed to make them grow
	up into a queen bee. Eating it provides a moderate amount of nutrition, around
	as much as four apples (four lumps of royal jelly are as filling as a food
	ration), helps its eater grow stronger, and even provides some small degree of
	healing.
mace
	A moderately large club with a heavy iron head, designed for use as a melee
	weapon. It is about as effective as a short sword, except that its bonus is
	against smaller rather than larger enemies, much the same as a battle-axe.
magenta potion
	A glass vial containing a bright reddish-purple liquid.
magenta spellbook
	A book, whose cover seems to rapidly change colour between a bluish red and a
	reddish blue. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
magic flute
	The beautiful magical sounds of this flute tend to make monsters fall asleep,
	although this enchantment will only work a limited number of times before
	requiring magical recharging. Even when out of magic, it can be used to play
	music.
magic harp
	The beautiful noise of this magical harp might tame nearby monsters into
	assisting you rather than fighting, although it only has enough magic to do
	this a limited number of times, before requiring magical recharging. Even when
	out of magic, it can still be used to play music.
magic lamp
	This sort of lamp is powered by the magical aura of a bound djinni, making it
	capable of burning forever, unless the djinni inside is somehow released. It's
	hard to tell what its opinion of its imprisonment is, or whether it would be
	happy to be released.
magic marker
	This short and wide plastic pen can be used to draw magical ink onto paper;
	this can be one of the fastest and most convenient ways to produce magical
	scrolls and spellbooks from ordinary paper, although considerable familiarity
	with a scroll or spellbook is needed to be certain it is written correctly. It
	only contains a finite amount of ink, though; and cannot survive having its
	ink supply being magically recharged more than once.
magic whistle
	This whistle is magical, teleporting pets next to you when used; this sort of
	device never runs out of magic.
maple wand
	A stick made of maple wood, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
marble wand
	A long and thin block of marble, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
meat ring
	A small piece of meat bent into a ring, which can be eaten but has only
	minimal nutritional content.
meat stick
	A very thin piece of meat, which can be eaten but has only minimal nutritional
	content.
meatball
	A tiny ball of meat, delicious as a treat for people or for dogs, but with
	only minimal nutritional content.
melon
	A large and substantial green fruit with a high water content. It is more
	filling than most other fruit, twice as much as an apple and slightly more so
	than an orange; and is enjoyed by both people and herbivorous animals.
milky potion
	A glass vial that seems to contain a milky white liquid.
mirror
	Some monsters are scared of their own reflections, and it can also be useful
	when used against monsters with a gaze attack.
moonstone ring
	A small ring with a moonstone set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
morning star
	A club with a large spiked iron head, designed for use as a melee weapon. It
	is as effective as a short sword or spear against larger enemies, but even
	more effective against smaller enemies than it is against larger ones.
mottled spellbook
	A book, with strange artistic patterns daubed onto the cover, resembling plant
	life. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a
	spell from it.
*mud boots
	Boots designed for protecting the feet from small puddles or shallow mud.
mummy wrapping
	The bandages that formerly wrapped a mummified body. For some reason, unlike
	most equipment, they don't turn invisible while worn by an invisible person,
	meaning that invisible people can use them to show other people where they
	are. They can be worn like a cloak above armour, but provide no protection to
	the body, although they do occasionally block certain types of special attacks
	used by monsters.
murky potion
	A glass vial containing brown liquid that resembles mud.
oak wand
	A heavy oaken stake unsuited for combat, that can be zapped to release a
	magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
obsidian
	This is one of the least valuable sorts of gemstone, being little more than an
	unusually valuable sort of naturally occuring glass, and thus not hard enough
	to make scratches in rock.
octagonal amulet
	A geometrically perfect iron octagon, connected to a chain so that it can be
	worn around a person's neck.
oil lamp
	This particular lamp uses ordinary oil as its energy source, burning for about
	three times as long as a wax candle when full; unlike a lantern, it can be
	refilled by dipping its spout into oil and letting the oil flow back into the
	main body of the lamp.
oilskin cloak
	It is very waterproof, designed to protect its wearer and his or her
	possessions from rain and splashes of water; and covers the body completely,
	giving almost perfect protection from some types of special attacks used by
	monsters. However, it is built for dryness rather than for any use as armour,
	and gives only minimal additional protection from blows.
oilskin sack
	It is possible to store items inside it; this saves backpack space,
	circumventing the normal restriction to 52 carried items. Items in bags are
	also protected from many forms of item-destroying attack. The weight of the
	items inside is still relevant, though. In addition, its oiled waterproof
	surface prevents water leaking into the bag, making items stored inside the
	bag immune to water damage.
*old gloves
	A tattered and worn-out pair of gloves.
opal
	It is small, round, and considered somewhat valuable as a gemstone, more so
	than a chrysoberyl or garnet; although not hard enough to scratch into rock.
opal ring
	A small ring with an opal set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
opera cloak
	A dramatic-looking cloak that's the height of upper-class fashion, designed to
	be worn above body armour.
orange
	An orange fruit from a tropical tree, with a tough skin and succulent juicy
	segments inside, enjoyed by people and by herbivorous animals alike. It is
	noticeably more filling than an apple, but only about as tenth as filling as a
	food ration.
orange dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	orange dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It
	also makes its wearer never need sleep, and likewise immune to any effects
	that would make him or her sleep.
*orange dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a orange dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also makes its wearer never need sleep, and likewise immune to
	any effects that would make him or her sleep.
orange gem
	An orange object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
orange potion
	A glass vial containing a subdued orange liquid.
orange spellbook
	A book, with a weirdly textured cover which might once have been the rind of
	an orange. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
orcish arrow
	The dubious quality of its manufacture, and of the iron it is made from,
	betrays the low-quality orcish manufacture of this arrow. Orcs are used to
	such arrows, though, and have a better rate of fire with them when also using
	an orcish bow.
orcish bow
	The orcish manufacture of this bow is obvious, but it seems to work just as
	well as more polished products; and orcish archers are actually more familiar
	with their own awkwardly made products.
orcish chain mail
	Its orcish construction makes it lower-quality than human-made chain mail, but
	it still provides good protection against attack, about as good as scale mail,
	and sometimes (although not very often) blocks some types of special attack
	used by monsters.
orcish cloak
	Its poor-quality orcish construction gives no additional protection to the
	body, although it does block certain types of special attacks used by monsters
	with a good success rate.
orcish dagger
	Its bad construction betrays its orcish manufacture, leaving it as bad against
	larger enemies as a typical dagger whilst not even having a bonus against
	smaller enemies, although it is still as accurate as other daggers.
orcish helm
	Its crude orcish manufacture provides only minimal protection from damage,
	although it will turn aside many falling objects. Its metallic nature makes it
	hard to focus on spellcasting, however.
orcish ring mail
	The orcs who constructed it clearly don't know that much about armour
	manufacture, and seem to have substituted quantity for quality, leading to
	body armour that only provides moderate protection, about as protective as
	leather armour, and less so than any other metal armour. However, the huge
	number of rings sometimes (although not very often) block some types of
	special attack used by monsters.
orcish shield
	Orcs use this sort of shield to disconcert their enemies; from a distance, the
	red eyes are all that can be seen amongst their otherwise entirely blackened
	equipment.
orcish short sword
	It is made to the same low standard that orcish smiths normally accomplish,
	being slightly weaker than a human-manufactured short sword.
orcish spear
	The poor-quality orcish manufacture of this spear makes it less effective than
	a typical spear or short sword. It works better against larger enemies.
ornamental cope
	A highly ornamental and fashionable cloak, designed to be worn above body
	armour.
oval amulet
	A rounded iron ellipse, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
*padded gloves
	Comfortable gloves with a padded interior.
pancake
	A thin but tasty food made from eggs and flour, often flavoured using sugar
	and lemon juice. It contains a lot of energy, and is around four times as
	filling as an apple (with four pancakes being as filling as a food ration).
pair of lenses
	Small pieces of glass designed to cover the eyes, protecting them from direct
	physical attack and making reading slightly easier.
papyrus spellbook
	A worryingly intricate book made from compressed reeds, giving off a strong
	and palpable magical aura.
parchment spellbook
	A book whose pages are made from the skins of dead animals via an expensive
	process. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn
	a spell from it.
partisan
	It is about as powerful as a typical spear or short sword, with a similar
	bonus against larger enemies.
pear
	A light green fruit, where typically both the skin and the flesh is eaten. It
	is similar to an apple, and about as filling; and enjoyed as food by both
	people and herbivorous animals.
pearl ring
	A small iron ring with a pearl set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
pick-axe
	An iron axe whose blade is very thin but very long; it is slightly less
	effective in combat than an ordinary axe, being just as good against small
	monsters as an ordinary axe or short sword, but with a huge penalty against
	larger monsters, against which it is no better than a dagger. Its shape means
	that it can be used to attack rock walls as well as enemies, eventually
	reducing them to a pile of rubble; and it is more commonly used for that
	purpose, than in combat.
piece of cloth
	A plain piece of cloth, which could be wrapped around the body in order to
	serve as a cloak above body armour.
pine wand
	A branch of a pine tree, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
pink potion
	A glass vial containing a shockingly pink liquid.
pink spellbook
	A book with light pink pages, smelling suspiciously of perfume. Reading it is
	dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
plaid spellbook
	A book, with a woven cover that somehow manages to be indescribably boring.
	Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell
	from it.
plain spellbook
	An empty book, with blank covers and no writing on the pages inside.
plate mail
	A heavy iron suit of body armour made out of plates connected by hinges,
	reinforced to provide incredibly good levels of protection against attack, and
	blocking many special attacks of monsters with a good success rate. That
	quantity of metal so close to the body, though, makes spellcasting almost
	impossible.
platinum wand
	A runed cylinder made of platinum, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
plumed helmet
	A fancy iron helmet with a plume.
pole cleaver
	A cleaver with an extremely long handle, requiring two hands to hold. Its
	length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies,
	but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
pole sickle
	A very long pole with a sickle blade at the end, requiring two hands to
	hold. Its length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent
	enemies, but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
polished silver shield
	A large silver shield, designed to be held in the offhand; it sometimes
	deflects attacks, more so than a small shield would. Holding a shield makes it
	harder to do the gestures associated with spellcasting, no matter what
	material it is made from.
potion of acid
	The bottle contains a powerful acid, dangerous to drink; allowing acids and
	water to mix is likewise a bad idea.
potion of blindness
	This potion strikes its drinker unable to see; the effect will wear off
	eventually but lasts a long time.
potion of booze
	This potion bottle contains non-magical alcohol, enjoyable but not
	particularly useful; side-effects of drinking it can include slurred speech,
	muddled thinking, and inability to walk in a straight line.
potion of confusion
	This potion makes its drinker confused, unable to think straight, talk
	straight, and occasionally even unable to walk straight. The effect wears off
	eventually, but not for a long time.
potion of enlightenment
	Drinking this potion gives its drinker a glimpse of self-knowledge that goes
	away almost as quickly as it comes, allowing them to know exactly what
	abilities they have, and exactly what magical effects are operating on them at
	the time.
potion of extra healing
	This potion quickly heals many of its drinker's wounds, leading to a moderate
	amount of instant healing; this improved potion of healing is almost twice as
	powerful. Healing potions might sometimes cure status problems too, depending
	on the problem and the strength of the potion; drinking healing potions when
	already unwounded might lead to a permanent increase in the amount of damage
	their drinker can take.
potion of fruit juice
	The bottle contains the non-magical juice squeezed from a rather interesting
	foodstuff, marginally nutritious but not particularly useful.
potion of full healing
	This potion quickly heals pretty much all its drinker's wounds, leading to a
	huge amount of instant healing; this vastly improved potion of healing is
	around twenty times as powerful. Healing potions might sometimes cure status
	problems too, depending on the problem and the strength of the potion;
	drinking healing potions when already unwounded might lead to a permanent
	increase in the amount of damage their drinker can take.
potion of gain ability
	This magical potion permanently makes its drinker stronger, more dexterous,
	healthier, more intelligent, wiser, or more attractive.
potion of gain energy
	This potion contains magical energy; drinking it slightly increases the amount
	of magical power its wearer's body can store, as well as slightly refilling
	their reservoir of power.
potion of gain level
	This potion contains liquid knowledge, magically and instantly making its
	drinker more skillful, experienced, and better in combat and at magic.
potion of hallucination
	This potion interferes with the mind and senses, giving its drinker a
	completely warped sense of reality where they cannot distinguish between
	monsters even as different as a dragon and an ant.
potion of healing
	This potion quickly patches up its drinker's minor wounds, leading to a
	relatively small amount of instant healing. Healing potions might sometimes
	cure status problems too, depending on the problem and the strength of the
	potion; drinking healing potions when already unwounded might lead to a
	permanent increase in the amount of damage their drinker can take.
potion of invisibility
	This potion turns its drinker invisible; the invisibility field extends out
	from the body to some extent, making their equipment invisible as well. The
	effect is usually temporary, unless the potion is empowered with a holy aura.
potion of levitation
	This potion lifts its drinker into the air, allowing them to float across
	water and over pits, but leaving them unable to reach the ground or move
	downstairs. The effect wears off suddenly and unexpectedly after a while,
	which can be fatal if it happens over water.
potion of monster detection
	This potion alerts its drinker to the locations of monsters; the ability to
	detect monsters has a long range, but does not work upwards or downwards, only
	sideways.
potion of object detection
	The drinker of this potion gets a sudden insight as to the location of all the
	treasure on their level, knowing what sort of object is where.
potion of oil
	The bottle contains non-magical oil, which can be ignited to act as a
	makeshift light source, or an even more makeshift thrown weapon.
potion of paralysis
	Drinking this dangerous potion leaves its drinker unable to move or react in
	any way for a while, during which they are rather vulnerable.
potion of polymorph
	This potion causes anyone who drinks it, or any item dipped into it, to
	instantly change to a new form (generally, in a random manner); the change is
	generally permanent, but if a creature changes into a substantially different
	form (say, a different species), they will change back after a while or
	reflexively if lethally wounded. Polymorph can be a dangerous effect, often
	having serious side effects and sometimes even lethal to inexperienced
	drinkers.
potion of restore ability
	This potion reverses the effects of poisons that weaken the body, and effects
	that drain its drinker's abilities, restoring all abilities up to their
	previous maximum values.
potion of see invisible
	This potion magically enhances its drinker's vision, allowing them to see even
	invisible monsters. The effect is usually temporary, but can be permanent if
	the potion is empowered with a holy aura.
potion of sickness
	This contaminated potion is poisonous; drinking it is a bad idea, although it
	can be used to coat some types of small projectiles for use poisoning enemies.
potion of sleeping
	This potion instantly causes its drinker to fall asleep. They wake naturally
	after a while, or might wake due to noise, injury, or other similar reasons.
potion of speed
	This potion temporarily makes its drinker move and act considerably faster
	than a normal person would; it is as good as or better than all other sources
	of magically fast movement, although two sources of magical speed are
	redundant, no better than just using one.
potion of water
	The water it contains is mostly only useful for getting things wet, but a holy
	or unholy aura can be transferred from water onto objects dipped into it.
pronged polearm
	A polearm with a pronged end, requiring two hands to hold. Its length prevents
	it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies, but it can be used
	to attack enemies slightly further away.
pruning hook
	A long pole with a sharpened hook at the end, requiring two hands to hold. Its
	length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies,
	but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
puce potion
	A glass vial containing a disgustingly-coloured liquid.
purple spellbook
	A book, which offputtingly seems to be somehow covered in bruises. Reading it
	is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
purple-red potion
	A glass vial containing a dark purple-red liquid.
pyramidal amulet
	An exotic iron pyramid, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
quarterstaff
	It is about as effective as a short sword against smaller enemies, but has no
	bonuses based on monster size.
ragged spellbook
	A book, looking rather the worse for wear, as if it has been used as a
	doorstop. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn
	a spell from it.
ranseur
	It is noticeably more powerful than a typical short sword (doing slightly more
	damage against larger enemies, against which it is just as powerful as against
	smaller enemies).
red dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	red dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	gives almost perfect protection from the effects of fire, heat, and flames,
	although it protects only the wearer, not his or her items.
*red dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a red dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also gives almost perfect protection from the effects of fire,
	heat, and flames, although it protects only the wearer, not his or her items.
red gem
	A red object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
red spellbook
	A book, with a bizarre cover made of solid red wax. Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
red-eyed shield
	A small blackened iron shield with a red eye painted on it, designed to be
	held in the offhand; it sometimes deflects attacks. Holding a shield makes it
	harder to do the gestures associated with spellcasting, no matter what
	material it is made from.
*riding boots
	Long boots designed for use when riding a horse.
*riding gloves
	Gloves which look designed for using to ride a horse.
ring mail
	A flexible shirt made by linking together many rings of iron, in a similar way
	as is used to make chain mail, but with larger rings and thus lower
	quality. It provides moderately good protection to the body, almost as good as
	scale mail, but its metallic construction interferes with spellcasting.
ring of adornment
	It adjusts its wearer's status in the eyes of others, making them more
	charismatic the more highly enchanted it is.
ring of aggravate monster
	It annoys nearby monsters, making hostile monsters more likely to notice the
	wearer's presence, and even tame monsters less willing to forgive
	maltreatment.
ring of cold resistance
	It protects its wearer (although not their equipment) almost perfectly from
	the effects of cold and low temperatures.
ring of conflict
	It angers creatures near one who wears it, making them attack anything and
	everything in a furious rage, even creatures that they would normally never
	dream of attacking; thus, it might be a useful distraction, but might also
	cause otherwise peaceful monsters to turn on its wearer. Some monsters may
	resist the effect, at least some of the time.
ring of fire resistance
	It protects its wearer (although not their equipment) almost perfectly from
	the effects of fire and flame.
ring of free action
	It protects its wearer almost perfectly from effects that would paralyse them
	and prevent them acting.
ring of gain constitution
	It adjusts its wearer's constitution, making them healthier the more highly
	enchanted it is.
ring of gain strength
	It adjusts its wearer's strength, making them beefier the more highly
	enchanted it is.
ring of hunger
	It is flawed in its manufacture, taking a large amount of nutrition from its
	wearer's body to power itself, but failing to give any benefit.
ring of increase accuracy
	It adjusts its wearer's aim, making them more accurate the more highly
	enchanted it is.
ring of increase damage
	It adjusts its wearer's force in combat, making their attacks more deadly the
	more highly enchanted it is.
ring of invisibility
	While worn, it hides its wearer and their equipment from view, making them
	impossible to see without magical aid.
ring of levitation
	It lifts its wearer high into the air, making them capable of floating over
	pits and water, but unable to reach the ground to pick up items or to go down
	stairs.
ring of poison resistance
	It completely protects its wearer from the effects of most poisons, including
	poisonous food, but not food mouldy with age; food poisoning is actually a
	sort of illness.
ring of polymorph
	It is powered by uncontrolled wild magic, occasionally randomly turning the
	wearer into a different type of creature, which could be very similar or very
	different. Radical changes will wear off over time, or automatically change
	back if the new form is fatally injured; slight changes (to a different member
	of the same race), though, will be permanent. The shock of the repeated
	changes can sometimes kill inexperienced wearers, so this ring can be risky to
	use.
ring of polymorph control
	It allows its wearer some degree of control over effects that would change
	their form, allowing them to select what sort of new form to change into with
	a very good chance of success.
ring of protection
	It adjusts its wearer's resistance to blows, making it harder to injure them
	the more highly enchanted it is.
ring of protection from shape changers
	While worn, it forces nearby shape-changing monsters into their natural form,
	making them incapable of shifting into more dangerous forms or hiding from the
	wearer disguised as something else.
ring of regeneration
	It causes its wearer to heal more quickly, although it takes more than the
	usual amount of food energy from its wearer to power it.
ring of searching
	It sometimes warns the wearer about nearby traps or secret doors, working as
	well as if the wearer were stopping every turn to search the surrounding area,
	but without the need for the wearer to actually stop and search.
ring of shock resistance
	It protects its wearer (although not their equipment) almost perfectly from
	the effects of electricity and lightning.
ring of slow digestion
	It provides its wearer with enough energy that they need metabolise no food
	themselves, although the wearer's food supplies are still needed to power the
	rings and amulets they wear, and even this ring itself takes a bit of food to
	power its own effect, so occasional eating is still necessary.
ring of stealth
	It reduces the noise made by its wearer's movements, allowing them to slip
	right past sleeping monsters without waking them up.
ring of sustain ability
	It protects its wearer's abilities from changes, making them basically
	impossible to change; although useful to prevent abilities being drained, it
	unfortunately also prevents them improving naturally.
ring of teleport control
	It allows the wearer to control where otherwise random teleportation effects
	would cause them to land, or choose to avoid teleporting entirely, although it
	grants no ability by itself to cause teleports to happen.
ring of teleportation
	It randomly teleports its wearer every now and then; some particularly
	experienced, and maybe magically gifted, wearers will be able to control when
	it teleports, but other wearers will just have to live with the whims of the
	uncontrolled wild magic that powers the ring. Additional magic is required to
	be able to choose the targets of the teleports.
ring of warning
	It warns the wearer of the existence of potentially dangerous enemies nearby
	that they cannot otherwise sense, giving a rough estimate of how dangerous a
	threat each one is.
robe
	A heavy cloth robe, designed to be worn as a cloak above body armour. It
	helps its wearer focus on spellcasting, making spells less likely to go wrong;
	and even provides a moderate amount of protection to the body, along with
	blocking certain types of special attacks used by monsters almost all the
	time.
rock
rock stone
	This common brownish stone is just a lump of rock, and not particularly
	useful; it might serve as sling ammunition or as a projectile in emergencies,
	although would not be particularly effective for either purpose.
rubber hose
	This moderate length of plastic can be used as a makeshift whip for
	bludgeoning enemies in melee; doing so does only small amounts of damage,
	about as much as a dagger (slightly more than a dart, but much less than a
	typical short sword).
ruby
	This is a slightly impure version of corundum; strangely, the impurities,
	which give it its famous red colour, also make it much more valuable. It is
	mostly only useful for its extremely high value, making it coveted treasure,
	although it is hard enough to scratch into rock without damage to itself.
ruby potion
	A glass vial containing a ruby-red liquid.
ruby ring
	A small ring with a ruby set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
runed arrow
	A wooden projectile with a fledged tail, and a tip sharpened to a point and
	hardened by fire, with runes carved into it. It is designed to be fired from a
	bow (throwing it by hand will only do minimal damage). It sometimes breaks on
	impact.
runed bow
	A piece of string with both ends connected to a curved piece of wood with
	runes engraved in it; wielding a bow allows arrows to be fired rather than
	thrown. Bashing monsters with a bow does not do much damage.
runed broadsword
	A large sword with a wide slashing blade, covered in runes.
runed dagger
	A long knife or very short sword made of sharpened wood, with runes engraved
	into it, which can be used as a melee weapon, or thrown by hand (with an
	unusually high rate of fire for skilled users).
runed short sword
	A hilted melee weapon with a moderately long blade made of hardened and
	sharpened wood, and covered with runes, well-balanced for use as an off-hand
	weapon.
runed spear
	A moderately long piece of wood, with a tip sharpened to a point and hardened
	by fire, with runes carved into it. It can be thrown by hand or used as a
	melee weapon.
runed wand
	A stick carved with ominous runes, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
runesword
	This iron sword has an alien appearance, being about as powerful as a short
	sword against larger enemies, but with a bonus against smaller enemies.
sack
	It is possible to store items inside it; this saves backpack space,
	circumventing the normal restriction to 52 carried items. Items in bags are
	also protected from many forms of item-destroying attack. The weight of the
	items inside is still relevant, though.
saddle
	A leather seat designed to fit on the back of a horse, or similarly-shaped
	animal. Sufficiently friendly horses may let you ride them if first saddled.
samurai sword
	A very well-crafted long sword made of high-quality iron.
sapphire
	This gemstone is extremely valuable, although not worth quite as much as a
	ruby, and hard enough to scratch into solid stone without damage to itself.
sapphire ring
	A small ring with a sapphire set into it, designed to be worn on a finger.
scale mail
	Armour made from many small scales of iron, overlapping to form a flexible
	pattern, and providing good protection against attack; this alternative
	construction to a chain-based construction is slightly weaker than
	high-quality chain mail, but stronger than the similar but lower-quality ring
	mail. Its metallic nature interferes with spellcasting.
scalpel
	A small knife with a tiny but sharp blade, made of some non-magnetic metal. It
	is as accurate as a dagger, and about as powerful against larger enemies, but
	does not have the bonus against smaller enemies that a dagger has.
scimitar
	It is slightly better than a typical short sword, being equally good against
	smaller and larger enemies.
scroll labeled *
	A rolled up piece of paper with magical writing on it; the only clue to its
	purpose to someone who does not recognise it is the label written on one
	side.
scroll of amnesia
	This scroll partially wipes its reader's memory, potentially causing them to
	forget item descriptions, maps, and/or spells.
scroll of blank paper
	Its complete lack of enchantment makes it relatively useless, except for
	writing on.
scroll of charging
	When read, it refills an item of its user's choice, with either fuel or
	magical energy (depending on what that item requires to function). Repeatedly
	charging and discharging an item tends to put quite a strain on it; some items
	that are charged too many times may break or explode.
scroll of confuse monster
	When read, it makes its reader's hands glow; subsequently touching a monster
	with the glowing hands causes it to become confused.
scroll of create monster
	When read, it magically creates a monster (or possibly several monsters) from
	nothing. Note that nothing forces the resulting monsters to be friendly.
scroll of destroy armor
	When read, it destroys a random piece of armor worn by its reader. It's not
	entirely clear why this scroll was invented in the first place; the leading
	theory is that some perverted wizard used it as an ingenious practical joke.
scroll of earth
	When read, it causes boulders to fall from the ceiling, around and/or above
	its reader.
scroll of enchant armor
	When read, it magically enhances a random piece of armor worn by its reader to
	become more protective. Note that there is a limit to how much enchantment
	armor will stand; enchanting armor too far may destroy it.
scroll of enchant weapon
	It magically enhances weapons held in its reader's hands to be more accurate
	and more damaging. Note that there is a limit to how much enchantment weapons
	will stand; enchanting weapons too far may destroy them.
scroll of fire
	This rather dangerous scroll explodes in a ball of fire when read; as its
	reader tends to be at the centre of the blast, reading it can be rather
	unwise.
scroll of food detection
	When read, this scroll informs its reader of the locations of everything
	edible on the current level. Note that just because it is possible to eat
	something, that does not necessarily mean that it is safe to eat.
scroll of genocide
	When read, this feared and dreaded scroll permanently and irreversibly erases
	a chosen type of monster from existence, such that from then on it exists only
	as a memory. Many powerful species of monster are under divine protection, and
	thus unable to be chosen.
scroll of gold detection
	Loved by the greedy, this scroll pinpoints the location of all the gold on the
	current level when read.
scroll of identify
	When read, this highly useful scroll informs its reader as to the exact
	purpose and enchantment of a chosen item (or possibly more than one item) in
	their inventory.
scroll of light
	Reading it causes the nearby area to permanently glow with magical light.
scroll of magic mapping
	Reading the words on this scroll gives their reader a mental image of a map of
	the current level; some levels are either magically protected from mapping, or
	too bizarre to successfully map, but in most cases the scroll will work
	correctly.
scroll of mail
	It contains a message from beyond the dungeon.
scroll of punishment
	Reading it attracts punishments from the gods; an incautious reader can end up
	chained to a heavy iron ball.
scroll of remove curse
	It lifts curses from its reader's equipment, or maybe even their inventory if
	it is first empowered with a holy aura.
scroll of scare monster
	Most monsters cannot bear to hear the words on this scroll spoken aloud, nor
	bear to read such a scroll lying on the ground, and will flee from it. Such
	scrolls tend to be fragile and will not survive being repeatedly lifted and
	dropped.
scroll of stinking cloud
	When read, it creates a large cloud of poison nearby; its reader can choose
	where it is located, and although it must be relatively near, it can be placed
	so that its reader is not caught in the blast.
scroll of taming
	The words on this scroll try to magically influence the minds of nearby
	monsters when read out loud, trying to make them change sides and cooperate
	with their reader. The success rate is far from perfect, though.
scroll of teleportation
	Reading it instantly transports the wearer to a different location. The
	scroll has no innate capability to choose any particular location, so by
	default the teleportation will be to somewhere random, but independent magic
	might be able to influence the spell's aim.
shield of reflection
	Its polished silver surface makes it work as a mirror, reflecting most visible
	ray and gaze attacks back at the monster that used them.
shining spellbook
	A book, happily shining as if to demonstrate the magical power within. Reading
	it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
shiny ring
	A highly polished circle of steel, designed to be worn on a finger.
short sword
	An iron melee weapon with a moderately long blade and a hilt, well-balanced
	for use as a weapon to hold in the off-hand with a more powerful weapon in the
	main hand. It does moderate amounts of damage, with a bonus against larger
	enemies.
short wand
	What looks like a magician's wand, but is unusually short; it can be zapped to
	release a magical effect, although only a limited number of times.
shuriken
	This weapon, manufactured by dishonourable samurai, can be deadly, with about
	twice the stopping power of a thrown dagger.
silver arrow
	A projectile with a fledged tail and pointed tip, made entirely from silver,
	designed to be fired from a bow (throwing it by hand will only do minimal
	damage). It sometimes breaks on impact. The expensive design makes this
	excellent ammo for firing at monsters susceptible to silver, but it is
	otherwise no better than a normal arrow.
silver bell
	A small and ridiculously intricate bell made of silver, giving off a strong
	and palpable magical aura.
silver dagger
	A long knife or very short sword made of silver, which can be used as a melee
	weapon, or thrown by hand (with an unusually high rate of fire for skilled
	users). Its expensive construction makes it particularly good against monsters
	vulnerable to silver, but it is no more effective than a normal dagger against
	typical enemies.
silver dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	silver dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. Its
	shiny reflective surface reflects most visible ray and gaze attacks back at
	the monster that used them.
*silver dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a silver dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. Its shiny reflective surface reflects most visible ray and gaze
	attacks back at the monster that used them.
silver wand
	A shiny stick of silver, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
silver ring
	A pretty circle of silver, designed to be worn on a finger.
silver saber
	A melee weapon with a moderately long slashing blade, similar to a short sword
	but with a different weight balance. Its silver blade makes it particularly
	effective against monsters susceptible to that material; even against other
	monsters, it is slightly better than a typical short sword, being equally good
	against smaller and larger enemies.
silver spear
	A moderately long pointed piece of silver, which can be thrown by hand or used
	as a melee weapon. Its expensive design makes it especially effective against
	monsters vulnerable to silver; but it is otherwise no better than a typical
	spear or short sword. Like most spears, it is better against larger enemies.
silver spellbook
	A book, whose silver pages reflect like perfect mirrors (but unfortunately,
	are too unwieldy to actually use for that purpose). Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
single-edged polearm
	A very long iron spear with one sharpened edge, requiring two hands to
	hold. Its length prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent
	enemies, but it can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
skeleton key
	It is magically enchanted to automatically adjust to open any lock, meaning
	that it can open and close locks very quickly.
sky blue potion
	A glass vial containing an airy light blue liquid.
slime mold
	A strange but surprisingly tasty foodstuff. It is also surprisingly
	nutritious, being around five times as filling as an apple, or just under a
	third as nutritious as a food ration.
sling
	A folded piece of cloth, which can be whirled around the head and then
	released in order to shoot a rock, stone or gemstone with great force; bashing
	monsters with a sling does not do much damage. The best stones to use with a
	sling are flint stones, which do as much damage as a short sword (but without
	a bonus against larger monsters); other rocks and gems will do slightly less
	damage than a dagger would.
slippery cloak
	A slippery cloak made from heavily oiled cloth, designed to be worn above body
	armour.
small shield
	A small wooden shield, designed to be held in the offhand; it sometimes
	deflects attacks. Holding a shield makes it harder to do the gestures
	associated with spellcasting, no matter what material it is made from.
smoky potion
	A glass vial that seems to contain liquid smoke.
*snow boots
	Boots with a broad base, designed to prevent their wearer sinking into snow or
	slipping on ice.
spear
	A moderately long pointed piece of iron, which can be thrown by hand or used
	as a melee weapon, doing about as much damage as a short sword. It works
	better against larger enemies.
*speed boots
	Whilst wearing these minimally protective leather boots, the wearer thinks,
	acts, and moves much faster, allowing them to attempt more attacks in the same
	space of time, or outrun many enemies; the boots even benefit wearers who are
	naturally quick on their feet, although not by as much as they would benefit
	slower wearers.
spellbook of blank paper
	Reading it is not particularly useful; the only sensible use for such a book
	is to write something on its blank pages.
spellbook of cancellation
	This powerful matter spell completely removes magical effects or abilities
	from items or monsters in a chosen direction. Many monsters are capable of
	resisting such effects, though, at least some of the time.
spellbook of cause fear
	This enchantment spell causes monsters to want to run away rather than
	fight. It is not infallible, though, even against monsters that seem to be
	affected.
spellbook of charm monster
	This enchantment spell makes nearby monsters friendly to the caster, although
	not with a perfect chance of success. It is more likely to work with more
	powerful casters and with less magic-resistant monsters. If it does work, the
	effect is permanent unless something is done to abuse the affected monsters.
spellbook of clairvoyance
	This divination spell maps a small area around the caster, showing what the
	local terrain is like.
spellbook of cone of cold
	This attack spell shoots a ray of frost in a chosen direction; more skilled
	casters will instead create a freezing explosion at a certain nearby location.
spellbook of confuse monster
	This enchantment spell causes its caster's hands to glow red, imbuing them
	with an energy that will confuse the next (or next several) monsters they
	touch with the glowing hands.
spellbook of create familiar
	This powerful clerical spell, developed by the same mages who originally
	developed "create monster", creates a tame monster to serve as the caster's
	pet. For some reason, it often (although far from always) creates common
	domestic animals, although more often than not it will create a monster common
	in the local environment instead.
spellbook of create monster
	This clerical spell creates a monster, or possibly several monsters, nearby;
	unfortunately, the research behind the spell is incomplete, meaning that the
	resulting monsters are typically hostile, and attack the caster who created
	them, although peaceful creatures are created on occasion.
spellbook of cure blindness
	This healing spell instantly cures all forms of blindness that might be
	affecting its caster, although it cannot remove a blindfold or similar piece
	of equipment that might prevent sight.
spellbook of cure sickness
	This healing spell instantly cures all forms of sickness and illness affecting
	its caster.
spellbook of detect food
	This divination spell alerts its caster to the locations and identities of
	nearby items of food.
spellbook of detect monsters
	This divination spell alerts its caster to the locations and identities of
	monsters on the current level. Although for most casters such an insight only
	lasts an instant, skilled casters can prolong the spell to last considerably
	longer.
spellbook of detect treasure
	This divination spell reveals the locations of items on the current level, and
	even some clues as to their identities (less skilled casters can discern
	general shapes, with more skilled casters also able to detect their visual
	appearances).
spellbook of detect unseen
	This divination spell reveals the existence of secret, hidden or invisible
	monsters or terrain nearby.
spellbook of dig
	This matter spell fires a magical ray that is harmless to creatures, but which
	destroys walls easily, leaving behind a tunnel large enough to walk in.
spellbook of drain life
	The dark energy of this attack spell (which can be aimed in a chosen
	direction) drains away some of the life energy of a creature it hits, or maybe
	some of the magical energy of an object, weakening it. However, it can be
	resisted, and does not affect creatures that are not alive.
spellbook of extra healing
	This extra-powerful healing spell, about twice as powerful as a basic healing
	spell, cures wounds suffered by the caster, or by a monster in a chosen
	direction.
spellbook of finger of death
	This dreaded attack spell shoots a ray of pure radiative energy that instantly
	kills anything it hits; the only protections against it are dodging the ray,
	absorbing it with certain types of magical protection, and being dead already
	(or at least non-alive). If an unwise caster aims this spell at him or
	herself, not even magical protection will help.
spellbook of fireball
	This attack spell shoots a ray of flame in a chosen direction; more skilled
	casters will instead create a fiery explosion at a chosen nearby location.
spellbook of force bolt
	This basic attack spell shoots a small discontinuity of force in a chosen
	direction; it is moderately good at attacking creatures, but particularly
	destructive against many sorts of inanimate objects.
spellbook of haste self
	This enchantment spell invigorates its caster's movements, making them move
	and act much more quickly than normal for a while. Note that it does not
	combine well with other sources of magical speed, with only the most powerful
	having an effect; it is, however, stronger than more permanent forms of fast
	movement.
spellbook of healing
	This is a simple healing spell, which can cure small wounds to some extent.
	Its caster can either use it to heal him or herself, or shoot it in a chosen
	direction to heal another creature.
spellbook of identify
	This divination spell reveals all properties and enchantments of a random
	number of chosen items in its caster's inventory, allowing them to know their
	identities.
spellbook of invisibility
	This escape spell turns its caster temporarily invisible, meaning that they
	can be seen only by monsters with some other method of detecting their
	location. The effect wears off after a while.
spellbook of jumping
	This escape spell allows its caster to immediately once make a surprisingly
	long (and magically aided) jump, landing a long distance away; it can lead to
	very fast movement, as the jumps take a comparable length of time to ordinary
	movement.
spellbook of knock
	This matter spell magically and instantly unlocks locks, fastenings and similar
	restraints in a chosen direction, allowing a person (or maybe just gravity) to
	easily open whatever was being locked or fastened.
spellbook of levitation
	This escape spell causes its caster to float in midair, unable to reach the
	ground, which can be useful for avoiding ground-based hazards. Unfortunately,
	it takes substantial skill to subsequently be able to determine how long the
	spell lasts, with only skilled casters being able to guarantee it lasts more
	than a few turns, and end it when they want; less skilled casters are stuck in
	midair until the effect ends, which might be almost immediately or not for a
	long time.
spellbook of light
	This divination spell causes the surrounding area to permanently shine with
	magical light, revealing anything that might be trying to hide under the cover
	of darkness.
spellbook of magic mapping
	This divination spell gives its caster a mental image of a map of the current
	level; note that some areas may be either magically warded against mapping, or
	just too bizarre to be able to map like that.
spellbook of magic missile
	This attack spell shoots a ray made out of bullets of magical energy in a
	chosen direction. More experienced casters will do substantially more damage
	with this spell.
spellbook of polymorph
	This matter spell, which can be cast to affect the caster or objects or
	monsters in a chosen direction, causes random changes to their form; neither
	objects nor creatures always survive such changes, and anything might resist
	this rather unpredictable spell.
spellbook of protection
	This clerical spell summons a golden haze around its caster, which can
	sometimes turn aside attacks, making them harder to hit in combat. The effect
	wears off relatively quickly, though.
spellbook of remove curse
	This clerical spell lifts the effects of curses from its caster's equipment;
	for more skilled casters, it can even affect the rest of their inventory.
spellbook of restore ability
	This healing spell recovers damage to its caster's abilities, that may have
	been suffered due to things like poison. Less skilled casters may need to cast
	it multiple times to fully restore all such damage.
spellbook of sleep
	This enchantment spell shoots a ray of sleep energy in a chosen direction,
	making monsters hit by it tend to fall asleep. Many monsters may resist,
	though, and some (especially those which do not sleep naturally) are immune to
	it.
spellbook of slow monster
	This enchantment spell slows, or permanently dispels effects which speed, a
	monster in a chosen direction. It cannot affect items that speed creatures up,
	though.
spellbook of stone to flesh
	This healing spell turns rock in a chosen direction into meat; it can be used
	to reverse the effects of being turned to stone, or just as a way to make
	random rocks edible. Walls are too large to be affected by such a spell, and
	must be chopped into smaller pieces first.
spellbook of teleport away
	This escape spell causes the caster, or a monster or object in a chosen
	direction, to be randomly moved elsewhere on the same level; although this
	spell itself has no way to control which location, other magic may be able to
	control such random teleportation.
spellbook of turn undead
	This clerical spell, developed for combating the walking dead, scares and
	damages such monsters in a chosen direction using an imposing beam of life
	energy. This sort of magic has been known to have side effects on certain
	objects which were once living.
spellbook of wizard lock
	This matter spell ensures that a chest, large box or doorway in a chosen
	direction is closed and locked; it will repair or create a door and/or a lock,
	if necessary, to achieve this.
spetum
	It is about as powerful as a typical long sword, with a similar bonus against
	larger enemies.
spherical amulet
	A pendulum-like iron sphere, connected to a chain so that it can be worn
	around a person's neck.
spiked wand
	This wand is made of iron. It is decorated with iron, and menaces with spikes
	of iron. It can be zapped to release a magical effect, although only a limited
	number of times.
splint mail
	A suit of body armour made out of vertical strips of iron riveted together,
	providing extremely good protection against attack, almost as good as plate
	mail. It also sometimes blocks many sorts of special attacks of monsters,
	although not with a particularly good success rate. Its metallic construction
	interferes with spellcasting.
sprig of wolfsbane
	A magical herb that is used for defence against werecreatures; eating
	wolfsbane is one of the few known cures for lycanthropy. It is a vegetable,
	and can be eaten as food, but it is not particularly nutritious, being
	slightly less filling than an apple.
square amulet
	An ornate iron square, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
staff
	A long piece of wood, designed for bludgeoning enemies in melee; it needs two
	hands to hold.
stained spellbook
	A book, still heavily coloured with the residues of acids and potions spilt
	onto it. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn
	a spell from it.
stamped scroll
	A neatly folded piece of paper in an envelope. A stamp in one corner shows
	that someone has paid for its delivery.
*statue*
	A lifelike artist's representation of a monster, carved out of rock. It seems
	to have no obvious use, although there might potentially be items inside it.
	Some statues might not be what they seem, either.
steel ring
	A simple circle of steel, designed to be worn on a finger.
steel wand
	A hefty steel bar, that can be zapped to release a magical effect, although
	only a limited number of times.
stethoscope
	A device made from steel that amplifies sounds coming from a particular area;
	it is very quick to use (being usable at the same time as any other action
	without taking more time than the other action would take by itself), and can
	be used to gain an idea of the health of a monster, or to try to ascertain
	whether or not terrain is not what it seems.
stiletto
	A small but sharp knife made of iron, advertised as being useful for
	self-defence but not particularly useful in combat, although it can be used as
	a melee weapon or thrown by hand. It is not very effective at damaging
	monsters, but is slightly less bad against small enemies than against large
	ones.
stout spear
	A moderately long, and unusually wide, pointed piece of iron, which can be
	thrown by hand or used as a melee weapon.
studded leather armor
	Armour made from hardened leather, with a huge number of small studs embedded
	in it to turn aside weapons. It provides moderately good protection to the
	body, about as good as ring mail and almost as good as scale mail, whilst also
	sometimes (although not very often) blocking some types of special attack used
	by monsters, all whilst avoiding metal that would interfere with spellcasting.
swirly potion
	A glass vial containing brown liquid that swirls about of its own accord.
t-shirt
	A cloth shirt with an allegedly witty slogan written on it, fitting tightly
	enough to be worn underneath other sorts of armour, although providing no
	protection to the body unless magically enchanted.
tallow candle
	It is of rather low quality, made from congealed grease, and thus will not be
	able to burn for a very long time, about half as long as a higher-quality wax
	candle would.
tan spellbook
	A book, with covers made from discarded paper bags. Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
tattered cape
	A cloth cape that's looking rather the worse for wear, that could be worn
	above body armour as a cloak.
thick spellbook
	A book, with thousands of small pages, most of which seem to have no
	purpose. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn
	a spell from it.
thin spellbook
	A book, that's more like a pamphlet or newspaper, being large but only a few
	pages long. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
thonged club
	An iron club attached to a strip of leather to allow it to be swung at an
	enemy.
throwing spear
	A moderately long pointed piece of metal, designed specifically to be thrown
	at enemies.
throwing star
	A tiny iron projectile with a serrated edge, designed to be thrown by hand. It
	sometimes breaks on impact.
tiger eye ring
	A small ring with a tiger-eye gem set into it, designed to be worn on a
	finger.
tin
	A metal container designed to stop the food inside it spoiling. Unfortunately,
	there's no obvious way to open it, except bashing it with a weapon until it
	breaks (maybe holding something sharp like a dagger would make bashing it open
	easier?), and there's no label, so the tin would need to be opened to
	determine its contents (after which it would spoil quickly).
tin opener
	Although almost useless in combat, this weirdly shaped piece of iron is useful
	for attacking small metal cylinders in an attempt to get at the contents
	inside. When held in the hand, it works even better than a dagger for opening
	tins of food.
tin wand
	A hollow cylinder made of tin, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
tin whistle
	This particular whistle is just an ordinary non-magical one, although it will
	attract the attention of nearby monsters when used, useful to let nearby pets
	know where you are.
tinning kit
	This iron device allows pieces of corpses to be placed into tins, preventing
	them rotting or spoiling and preserving them for later use. It comes with
	material for a large but finite number of tins; deep in a dungeon, the only
	plausible way to restore it is via magic.
tooled horn
	Although this horn is non-magical, its dramatic noise might sometimes scare
	nearby monsters into running away.
topaz
	Although hard enough to scratch into rock without damage to itself, this
	gemstone is nonetheless only quite valuable, less so than citrine, turquoise,
	amber, or any other hard gem.
topaz ring
	A small ring with a piece of topaz set into it, designed to be worn on a
	finger.
touchstone
	This rock is useful in identifying gems, reacting differently according to
	what is rubbed on it. Gnomes and archaeologists are skilled with the use of
	these devices, and can determine a lot about the gem in question; but even an
	amateur will be able to distinguish fakes from genuine gemstones.
towel
	This useful piece of cloth is designed to wipe water off wet objects, but has
	numerous other uses; for instance, it can be used to clean dirty hands and
	faces, or wrapped around the head to block out light.
triangular amulet
	A dramatic iron triangle, connected to a chain so that it can be worn around a
	person's neck.
trident
	A metal spear modified to have three points rather than the usual one, making
	it much more effective than a normal spear, about as powerful as a long sword
	but with an even larger bonus against larger enemies, and with a larger bonus
	still against monsters that live in water. It can be thrown by hand or used as
	a melee weapon.
tripe ration
	The stomach of an animal, still full of undigested food. Although humans and
	most other intelligent races find this disgusting, being able to eat them but
	with lots of bad side effects, dogs consider this one of the best treats
	available.
tsurugi
	This one shows signs of having been more heavily enchanted in the past.
turquoise spellbook
	A book, whose covers are made from thin slivers of semi-precious blue and
	green gems. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
turquoise
	Turquoises vary from almost blue to almost green in colour, and are considered
	very valuable despite their relative softness, more so than pretty much any
	other soft gem, and almost as valuable as an emerald.
twisted ring
	Several strands of iron strangely twisted together into a single circle,
	designed to be worn on a finger.
two-handed sword
	A huge iron sword that requires two hands even to lift. It deals devastating
	amounts of damage (about twice as much as a short sword) even to small
	enemies, and has a huge bonus against larger enemies, dealing around two and a
	half times as much damage as a short sword, and over one and a half times as
	much damage as a long sword.
unicorn horn
	This horn was taken from the body of a dead unicorn, and is an amazing cure
	for most ailments, rapidly curing all types of poisons, illnesses, and many
	other status problems. It could also be used as a weapon, although it is heavy
	enough that it needs two hands to hold; used for this purpose, it does about
	twice as much damage as a short sword, or as much as a two-handed sword,
	against smaller enemies, although it has no bonus against larger enemies.
unlabeled scroll
	A rolled up piece of paper. It has no writing on it.
uranium wand
	A worryingly glowing metal stick, that can be zapped to release a magical
	effect, although only a limited number of times.
uruk-hai shield
	This particular shield pattern is the mark of the Uruk-hai, a fearsome race of
	orcs.
vellum spellbook
	A book whose pages are made from the skins of specially bred animals via an
	expensive process. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader
	can learn a spell from it.
velvet spellbook
	A book, with high-quality purple fabric making up its covers. Reading it is
	dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
violet gem
	A violet object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
violet spellbook
	A book, whose purple covers are made from some kind of plant, which might even
	still be alive. Reading it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can
	learn a spell from it.
visored helmet
	An iron helmet with an imposing visor.
voulge
	It is noticeably more powerful than a typical short sword (doing slightly more
	damage against larger enemies, against which it is just as powerful as against
	smaller enemies).
vulgar polearm
	A simple but very long iron spear, requiring two hands to hold. Its length
	prevents it doing more than minimal damage against adjacent enemies, but it
	can be used to attack enemies slightly further away.
*walking shoes
	Comfortable leather shoes designed for walking in.
wand of cancellation
	Zapping it at a monster or item removes its magical abilities, although some
	items and monsters may completely or partially resist. It also removes some
	other sorts of lingering magical effects, such as enchantments and curses.
wand of create monster
	Zapping it creates one, or occasionally more, monsters. Unfortunately, they
	are quite likely to be hostile, and so the wand is mostly only good if you're
	looking for a fight.
wand of cold
	Zapping it produces a ray of cold that freezes all it touches. The ray is
	capable of bouncing off walls, but has only a limited range.
wand of death
	This dreaded wand's zaps produce rays that kill all they touch, although they
	have no effect on monsters that are dead already. The ray is capable of
	bouncing off walls, but has only a limited range.
wand of digging
	Zapping it at a wall or floor creates a tunnel big enough to walk through. If
	you take out the ground beneath your feet, you'd better expect to fall...
wand of enlightenment
	Zapping it informs the one who zapped it of their own magical powers, and of
	their god's opinion of them.
wand of fire
	Zapping it produces a ray of fire that burns all it touches. The ray is
	capable of bouncing off walls, but has only a limited range.
wand of light
	Zapping it permanently lights up the area near where it was zapped.
wand of lightning
	Zapping it produces a ray of lightning, that bounces off walls, but has only a
	limited range. In addition to electrifying things it hits, the ray is bright
	enough to cause temporary blindness.
wand of magic missile
	Zapping it at a monster barrages it with magically produced bullets. The
	damage output is somewhat underwhelming, though. The ray produced by this wand
	is capable of bouncing off walls, although it has only a limited range.
wand of make invisible
	Zapping it at a person or monster causes it to turn invisible, permanently. I
	suppose you could use it on yourself, but you would then have trouble being
	seen.
wand of nothing
	Although zapping it seems to have a magical effect, it isn't one that
	accomplishes anything.
wand of opening
	Zapping it at a lock causes it to instantly unlock, whether the lock is on a
	door, a container, or something else. It might be able to open other things,
	too.
wand of polymorph
	Zapping it at a monster or item causes it to change into a different type of
	monster or item, although items tend to change into similar sorts of item.
	This sort of magic is relatively uncontrolled, and sometimes works in
	unintended ways, perhaps damaging or destroying its target, or accidentally
	making an item into a monster.
wand of probing
	Zapping it at a monster reveals some information about it, such as its current
	hitpoint count and inventory. It can determine the inventory of containers,
	too.
wand of secret door detection
	Zapping it alerts the one who zapped it to the location of concealed dungeon
	features, such as secret doors, traps, and portals, nearby.
wand of sleep
	Zapping it produces a soporific ray that causes monsters it hits to fall
	asleep. The ray can bounce off walls, but has only a limited range.
wand of slow monster
	Zapping it at a monster causes it to slow down, acting in slow motion, and
	thus make it easier to run from and perform fewer attacks. Many monsters can
	resist the effects, though, with varying chances of doing so.
wand of speed monster
	Zapping it at a monster causes it to permanently speed up; and it can also be
	aimed at its user. This sort of permanent speed boost does not add together
	with other sorts, though; only the most powerful speeding effect will have any
	effect.
wand of striking
	Zapping it causes it to attack everything in a chosen direction, doing
	moderate damage to creatures and huge damage to many sorts of inanimate
	object.
wand of teleportation
	Anything it is zapped at is instantly teleported to a different square on the
	same level. Although you can aim this wand at yourself, some unusual
	environments make it impossible for a person to teleport deliberately. The
	square on which the teleport ends will be random, unless separate magic is
	used to be able to control it.
wand of undead turning
	Zapping it causes undead monsters in a chosen direction to either flee in
	fear, or possibly even be destroyed completely. This sort of magic often has
	unintended side effects on things other than undead that were once alive.
wand of wishing
	This incredibly valuable wand, which can only be recharged once and which can
	hold at most three charges at a time, grants anyone who zaps it the ability to
	wish for an item, or stack of similar items, of their choice. Almost anything
	can be requested, although the wand may find it difficult or impossible to
	make certain artifacts. Other properties of the items, such as enchantments,
	may also be specified, but might not be received, and likewise the resulting
	stack may be smaller than desired.
war hammer
	A heavy iron hammer designed specifically for use as a weapon, either wielded
	in melee or thrown by hand. It is about as effective as a short sword against
	smaller enemies, but has a penalty rather than a bonus against larger enemies,
	against which it is no better than an axe and only slightly better than a
	dagger.
*water walking boots
	These minimally protective leather boots can walk on water as if it were dry
	land, and so are very useful for crossing lakes and rivers.
wax candle
	It is made from high-quality beeswax, allowing it to burn for about twice as
	long as a typical tallow candle.
whistle
	A small tin device that makes a loud noise when blown through. It does not
	work well for playing music, though, as it can only play one note.
white dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	white dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It also
	gives almost perfect protection from the effects of cold and ice, although it
	protects only the wearer, not his or her items.
*white dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a white dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also gives almost perfect protection from the effects of cold
	and ice, although it protects only the wearer, not his or her items.
white gem
	A white object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
white potion
	A glass vial containing plain white liquid.
white spellbook
	A book, its covers as white as the pages inside. Reading it is dangerous, but
	a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
white-handed shield
	A small iron shield with an ominous white hand painted on it, designed to be
	held in the offhand; it sometimes deflects attacks. Holding a shield makes it
	harder to do the gestures associated with spellcasting, no matter what
	material it is made from.
wire ring
	A ring made by connecting together many small pieces of steel wire, designed
	to be worn on a finger.
wooden flute
	This non-magical flute is mostly only useful for playing tunes on, although a
	sufficiently skilled player might be able to use it to charm snakes.
wooden harp
	Its beautiful noise is sometimes capable of charming nymphs, especially when
	played by a skilled player.
wooden ring
	A simple circle of wood, designed to be worn on a finger.
worm tooth
	A tooth taken from a dead worm, just about usable as a makeshift knife, but
	less effective in combat than anything designed as a weapon.
worthless * glass
	This appears to be a fake, a piece of glass that looks like it might be a
	gemstone, but in fact completely valueless.
wrinkled spellbook
	A book, shrunken like a walnut or an ageing balloon. Reading it is dangerous,
	but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
ya
	This arrow was manufactured by samurai, and is very high quality, putting even
	elvish ammunition to shame; samurai are particularly skilled with it when
	using a yumi.
yellow dragon scale mail
	A hugely protective suit of armour made magically from the scales of a dead
	yellow dragon; armour made from dragons protects better than any other. It
	also gives its wearer almost perfect protection from the effects of acid and
	corrosive liquids, although it protects only the wearer, not his or her
	equipment.
*yellow dragon scales
	Some scales taken from the dead body of a yellow dragon; wearing it provides
	moderately good protection to the body, about as much as studded leather or
	ring mail. It also gives its wearer almost perfect protection from the effects
	of acid and corrosive liquids, although it protects only the wearer, not his
	or her equipment.
yellow gem
	A yellow object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general, magical
	identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how valuable
	apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and proof of a
	stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
yellow potion
	A glass vial containing a creamy yellow liquid.
yellow spellbook
	A book, its pages yellowing through some former exposure to sunlight. Reading
	it is dangerous, but a sufficiently skilled reader can learn a spell from it.
yellowish brown gem
	A yellowish-brown object cut into facets, looking like a gemstone. In general,
	magical identification or abilities as a jeweller are needed to determine how
	valuable apparent gemstones are, or even whether they are real or fake; and
	proof of a stone's value is needed to be able to sell it at a shop.
yumi
	This bow is of top-quality samurai manufacture; although it is normally no
	more powerful than a standard bow, samurai are particularly familiar with how
	to gain the best from such a bow.
zinc wand
	A plain cylinder of zinc, that can be zapped to release a magical effect,
	although only a limited number of times.
