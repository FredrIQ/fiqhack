   movement functions, that specifies the extent to which the player is trying
   to interact with items. Not all appropriate commands use this mechanism yet.

   This is also used by the "movecommand" game option. As such, all the enum
   entries should start with a different letter (to simplify the user interface
   for options), and you need to update the list in options.c whenever you
   change this list.

   Commands are able to override the interaction mode downwards, but not
   upwards; overrides are often needed due to the semantics of the command
   (e.g. farmove shouldn't stay in place trying to attack monsters). The
   exception is the F command, which overrides absolutely anything.

   When changing this list, update resolve_uim in hack.c. */
