/* 
 * This file contains two sets of message-handling code:
 *
 * - pline() and friends, which handle printing messages;
 * - msgcat() and friends, which handle allocating messages.
 *
 * All the declarations for the relevant functions, enums, etc. are here rather
 * than in extern.h (because extern.h should ideally get smaller over time).
 *
 * A message itself is a "const char *" that's either a string literal, or else
 * on the message chain, and is for most purposes treated as a read-only object
 * that spontaneously deallocates at the end of the turn (and should not be
 * deallocated manually).  Note that pointer arithmetic on a message, to remove
 * characters from the left hand side, is allowed and will work correctly. NULL
 * is not valid as a message (although you can certainly write a function that
 * takes a "message-or-NULL" argument if you want to).
