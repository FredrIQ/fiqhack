/* SAVEBREAK: Cruft from old mextra system. In older save files, the very first thing to be
   saved was name length (16bit, but interestingly the name was capped at 63) and type of
   mon->mextra (16bit). The type was compared with the enum below (which didn't have
   "legacy" all over it) and the game was saved/restored based on it. To account for this,
   until a savebreak is performed, monst has 16 dummy bits on start, plus 16 bits of
   "legacy" extype. This is *always* saved as MX_(NO|YES), and if a restore finds anything
   else, the save file is assumed to follow the old system and is read accordingly. For
   the next savebreak, extypes_legacy will be removed entirely and a "has mextra" flag will
   be saved into the mflags part instead.
   (MX_(NO|YES) determines whether or not a monster has a mextra) */
