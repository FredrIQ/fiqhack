/* We have many RNGs. Things that couldn't reasonably be expected to line up
   between games are on rng_main (gameplay-affecting) or rng_display
   (non-gameplay-affecting); things can't be expected to line up if they depend
   strongly on player actions (e.g. turn boundary or combat), or if how much
   they help/hurt the player is heavily context-dependent and there's no control
   over the context (e.g. helplessness duration).  Bones generation is also on
   rng_main, because there's no sensible reason to keep it consistent between
   games.

   For things that could, we have specific RNGs (typically highly specific, so
   that you can't use up unwanted random numbers destined for one purpose via
   using them on something else).  These mostly correspond to ways of generating
   things (monsters, items, etc.).  These also include random durations with
   /strategic/ effects, e.g. prayer timeout.

   One special case is the level generation RNGs. There is one of these for
   each level, which handles all the aspects of the generation of that level
   that aren't affected by the character. It also handles the /species/ of
   randomly generating monsters on the level after that (but the other details
   are on the main RNG, to avoid desyncing it). As of the time of writing,
   the total number of RNGs needed for this is:

   29 (Dungeons) + 24 (Gehennom) + 9 (Mines) + 6 (Quest) + 4 (Sokoban) +
   1 (Ludios) + 3 (Vlad's) + 6 (Planes, including 1 dummy level) = 82.

   To allow for future expansion, we preserve 110 RNGs for this purpose.  (If
   a level ledger number goes above 109, we don't crash, but rather, recycle
   some of the existing RNGs. This will lead to games being played on the
   same seed no longer having identical levels, but that's forgivable.)

   Don't worry about save compatibility when adding new RNGs; nothing will break
   if they start using each other's seedspaces.  Games are only really
   comparable if played on the same version anyway.
