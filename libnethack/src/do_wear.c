/* The commands wxQWTRPA (and the use of a to equip eye-slot items) are all now
   merged into one standard API for equipping and unequipping. (There are still
   some codepaths for equipping that don't use this API; for instance, the use
   of V to wield a lamp, or a to wield a pick-axe. That happens when a command
   needs to equip an item and do something else in the same action; in the case
   of the lamp, it would be rubbing it.)

   u.utracked[tos_first_equip ... tos_last_equip] hold the item that the player
   wants to place in each swap; this is a persistent value, saved in the save
   file. They can be legally set to any valid object pointer, regardless of
   whether it's appropriate for the slot, or even whether it's in the player's
   inventory. Use &zeroobj to request that nothing is stored in the slot; NULL
   represents that no change is desired. We use this convention for two reasons:
   a) because if an object is destroyed while in utracked, the corresponding
   slot of utracked becomes NULL; b) because that way, if an item is stolen
   independently of the equip code, the player won't automatically re-equip it
   if they subsequently pick it up.

   This function handles the actual equipping. The rules are as follows:

   - If an action can't even be attempted because the item isn't in inventory,
     it's skipped entirely. This means that the player can start to wear an
     item, be interrupted, and choose to continue wearing once they reclaim it,
     with the benefits of their accumulated progress. (TODO: This makes no
     sense at all.)

   - If the action can be attempted but doesn't work (e.g. is blocked by a
     cursed item), we print out a message and NULL the slot. This takes 1
     action, or 0 if the action could normally be done for free, rather than the
     normal time it takes to equip the item.

   - If all the actions that the player wants to perform are free (such as
     quivering, or swapping the main and offhand), then this function performs
     all of them (printing appropriate messages), and returns 0.

   - Otherwise, it increases the action reservoir (uoccupation_progress for the
     appropriate slot) by 1, and compares it to the length of time taken by the
     next action to perform:

       - If the action takes more time than is in the reservoir, the function
         returns 2 with no further action.

       - If the action takes no more time than is in the reservoir, then the
         time is taken from the reservoir and the action is performed. (The slot
         is NULLed out in response, except when unequipping an item temporarily
         to put on another, when it's set to the old item.) Then any number of
         zero-time actions that might be scheduled to happen after that occur,
         and then the function returns 2 if there are actions remaining, 1
         otherwise.

   The correct use for this function in a command, then, is to set utracked,
   reset the reservoir if any objects were removed from utracked, then call
   equip_heartbeat. If it returns 0 or 1, return the same value. If it returns
   2, call action_incomplete(), then return 1. */

         * also has the side-effect of cancelling the unequip in the offhand
         * slot if the mainhand weapon turns out to be cursed; this is

         * action (fast swap, followed by re-equipping the offhand slot), and
         * this is perfectly safe (moving a cursed item to offhand is not a
         * problem, moving a cursed item to mainhand is what the user requested
         * so it's OK to do even if the item is cursed). Therefore, we also
         * enable the fast swap in this case. We don't use it if the offhand is
         * empty and the mainhand is desired empty, though; just unequipping the

/*
 * canwearobj checks to see whether the player can wear a piece of armor or
 * jewellery (i.e. anything that can meaningfully have bits in W_WORN set). It
 * does not return useful information for the wield slot, because that would
 * cause a TRUE return in almost any situation (basically anything is
 * wieldable), and thus rather complicate the code for W, which doesn't wield.
 * (You can determine if an item is potentially wieldable via seeing whether
 * it's currently worn; all items that are neither worn (including as a saddle)
 * nor welded are wieldable, although c corpses may well cause instant death
 * upon trying, and they aren't the only try-then-fail case; ready_weapon is the
 * appropriate function to use to attempt the actual wielding.)
 *
 * This is used in three basic contexts:
 *
 * a) As a check in response to the user giving the command to wear a piece of
 *    armor (noisy != FALSE, spoil == FALSE). In this case, the code will
 *    pline() out explanations about why the armor can't be worn, if it can't be
 *    worn. This is based on character knowledge; if it returns FALSE, the
 *    character will know it won't work and won't waste a turn trying.
 *
 * b) To check to see if and where an item can be equipped, in preparation for
 *    presenting a menu of sensible options to the user, or to determine
 *    whether the item is still worn after polymorph. In this case, the code
 *    will stay quiet about mistakes and just return FALSE. This is based only
 *    on character knowledge, so may return TRUE in situations where the item
 *    cannot be equipped (if the character does not know why it cannot be
 *    equipped).
 *
 * c) While the character is trying to equip the item (neither noisy nor spoil
 *    is false). This will use actual knowledge about BCUs, and set bknown
 *    accordingly.
 *
 * This function now also checks for the amulet, ring, and blindfold slots. In
 * the case of rings, *mask will be W_RING if both ring slots are free,
 * W_MASK(os_ringl) or W_MASK(os_ringr) if only one ring slot is free.
 *
 * You can get different outcomes from this function using the cblock value.
 * With cblock == TRUE, the return values are based on what could be
 * accomplished via removing items in other slots. With cblock == FALSE, the
 * return values are based on what could be accomplished right now (e.g. armor
 * will be blocked by a perfectly removable suit of armor or a cloak). cblock
 * is mutually exclusive with spoil; if you're trying to move the item right
 * now, it's important that the slot is unblocked even if you theoretically
 * could unblock it.
 *
 * inputs: otmp (the piece of armor)
 *         noisy (TRUE to print messages; FALSE to stay silent)
 *         spoil (TRUE to use game knowledge; FALSE to use character knowledge)
 *         cblock (when TRUE, consider items in blocking slots to block the
 *                 equip only if known to be cursed)
 * output: mask (otmp's armor type)
