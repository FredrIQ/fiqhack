/* ----------  BEGIN FILE LOCKING HANDLING ----------- */

/*
 * change_fd_lock is the general locking/unlocking/upgrading/downgrading
 * routine. We conceptually have four kinds of lock status (each of which is
 * strictly stricter than the one before):
 *
 * - No lock. Anything can happen to the file, and we don't know about it.
 *
 * - Monitor lock. The file can change, but we're notified when that happens
 *   (and do a server cancel). This sort of lock is only supported on
 *   program_state.logfile.
 *
 * - Read lock. The file cannot change, but we don't mind other processes
 *   reading it at the same time.
 *
 * - Write lock. We're taking control of changing the file; other processes
 *   cannot read it while we're changing it.
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, upgrading directly from a read lock to a write lock is
 * forbidden; you must drop down to a monitor lock in between.
 *
 * The implementation varies by OS. On Linux (and other POSIX with real-time
 * signals):
 *
 * - No lock: we hold no locks on the file
 *
 * - Monitor lock: we hold a read lock on the file using fcntl, and relinquish
 *   it if we receive a SIGRTMIN+1
 *
 * - Read lock: we hold a read lock on the file using fcntl, and block
 *   SIGRTMIN+1 until we finish reading (thus preventing other processes from
 *   writing, as we won't respond to their SIGRTMIN+1s until we're done)
 *
 * - Write lock: we hold a write lock on the file using fcntl; if we can't
 *   establish it, we SIGRTMIN+1 processes holding it until we can; SIGRTMIN+1
 *   is blocked, but only after the write lock has been established (so that if
 *   two processes want to write at once, they don't deadlock on each other)
 *
 * The key invariant here is *if a file is write-locked by any process, all
 * processes have been informed of the write*. This is the case regardless of
 * any signals sent anywhere; if a process has a write lock, then there are no
 * processes with a read lock (by definition), and all processes with monitor
 * locks have reliquished their locks in order to allow the write (and thus are
 * aware of the write). The only purpose of the signals is to allow a write lock
 * to be established in the first place (SIGRTMIN+1), to inform other processes
 * that the write lock has been established so that they don't re-lock the file
 * before the write can happen (SIGRTMIN+2), and to inform other processes that
 * the file is now unlocked (SIGRTMIN+4). None of these signals have any effect
 * on write notification; they are both just to make the writes actually capabe
 * of handling.
 *
 * The code, and documentation, is written in terms of SIGRTMIN+1 for the
 * "unlock" signal, but there is also a second unlock signal, SIGRTMIN+0, which
 * works identically in most ways. The difference is that processes use
 * SIGRTMIN+1 when communicating with processes with higher PIDs, and SIGRTMIN+0
 * when communicating with processes with lower PIDs. This introduces asymmetry
 * that is used to resolve otherwise symmetrical situations, like two processes
 * trying to write simultaneously. There is likewise a SIGRTMIN+3 which
 * corresponds to SIGRTMIN+2, for communicating with processes with higher PIDs.
 * (This is so that 0 and 2, and 1 and 3, can always be masked simultaneously to
 * get the signals in the right order).
 *
 * The behaviour on Windows is currently much more primitive (any Windows
 * experts out there to help?): we lock the file at LT_READ or higher, and leave
 * it unlocked at LT_MONITOR or lower. This means that watching games locally
 * doesn't work properly (watching games played on a server still works, though,
 * because the server itself is running UNIX, and the mechanism via which server
 * cancels are relayed to the client has nothing to do with the locking
 * mechanism). Watching local games is still possible on Windows, but the screen
 * will not update until a key is pressed.  (In this sense, watching a game is
 * quite like resizing a window; both only react on keypress.)

#ifdef AIMAKE_BUILDOS_linux
/*
 * We want to be notified about changes to the logfile; and we want to ensure
 * that the logfile is always locked when we read from it.
 *
 * There are basically two ways we could do this:
 *
 * - When receiving a SIGRTMIN+1, send a server cancel. Then unlock the logfile
 *   when the server cancel is reflected from the client.
 *
 * - When receiving a SIGRTMIN+1, unlock the file immediately, then relock it
 *   later in the same signal handler. Send a server cancel some time during
 *   this process, but don't care about when or if it's reflected.
 *
 * The first method is perfectly safe with respect to signal and lock timing,
 * and would be the "usual" way to do things. However, the problem is that it
 * requires the client to reflect server cancels in a timely manner, meaning
 * that we need a lot of discipline from the clients (and a lot of complexity in
 * the network server code to prevent malicious clients disrupting the locking
 * behaviour).
 *
 * The second method is much easier on the communications security front; if it
 * fails to reflect a server cancel, it will only affect that client (thus it's
 * its own fault that it's malfunctioning), and if it sends spurious server
 * cancels, that won't affect the server.  However, it makes the signal safety
 * properties harder to reason about; blocking on signals inside a signal
 * handler is almost unheard of.
 *
 * This code uses the second method; receiving a SIGRTMIN+1 will block for up to
 * three seconds, hopefully much less (SIGRTMIN+2 is used to end the blocking
 * early).  In order to prevent the logfile being written to while we're reading
 * it (thus implementing a read lock), SIGRTMIN+1 is masked while performing a
 * read operation; a process can ask us to unlock the file, but until we're done
 * reading, we're not going to (and we're not even going to look at the request,
 * we'll get to it once the reading's over).
 *
 * TODO: Should these be namespaced? program_state is the obvious namespace for
 * them. If namespacing this global (and others like it), remember to keep the
 * "volatile".

       SIGRTMIN+1 and SIGRTMIN+2 temporarily; this lets us receive recursive
       SIGRTMIN+1 signals and SIGRTMIN+2 signals.

       Actually doing the temporary unblock is hard; sigtimedwait lets us
       simulate one, but is not thread-safe (and the UI may be threaded);
       pselect is safe, but needs an absolute rather than relative signal mask,
       and we can't get the current mask to compare from sigprocmask (not
       thread-safe) or pthread_sigmask (not async-signal-safe). Using an empty
       mask doesn't work either; the UI might want to block SIGPIPE, for
       instance.

       The solution is to use the third argument to the signal handler; it holds
       what is effectively a siglongjmp() buffer, but with some fields split out
       in a portable way. One of those fields is the signal mask that was in
       place before the signal happened, which is just what we need; we don't
       even need to do operations on it to specify the signal we need. Thus, the
       solution to there being no appropriate API calls is that there's a way to
       get the information with no API calls.

       We do, however, need to delete the signals we want to receive from the
       signal mask; this is SIGRTMIN+1,3,4. (We take 0 and 2 from the signal
       mask.) The problem is that the mask in ucontext can have signals masked
       even if they were temporarily unmasked by pselect, sigsuspend, or the
       like. Somehow, strace manages to report this argument incorrectly, even
       if its value is copied to another memory location. (A small test program
       shows the argument containing no signals, yet behaving differently if
       signals are removed from it.)

       Interestingly, setcontext(), the POSIX API call that is intended to be
       used with the third argument, was removed from POSIX in 2008. However,
       the third argument to a sigaction() callback is still there, even though
       this is close to the only use that can be made of it (especially because
       SUSv2 documents that setcontext() doesn't actually work for exiting
       signal handlers).

       Huh, I guess that void * was useful after all. Now I wonder if it's a
       void * for future expansion, or just a void * because most people don't
       need ucontext.h, given that it defines a mechanism that doesn't actually
       work. */

           to SA_RESTART). The problem is that the signal can arrive between the
           sigrtmin1_some_locker call and the fcntl call, in which case, the
           wait happens too long; and there's no pfcntl() call to help us out.
       
           One thing we can do, though, is attempt to set the lock in a
           non-blocking manner. If it works, fine. If it doesn't, we can wait
           until we receive a signal. Thus, we only have to consider reasons why
           the lock might become establishable without a signal. For a read
           lock, this involves process A finishing writing when it was process B
           that told us to relinquish the lock (for an unrelated write). For a
           write lock, this involves a process relinquishing on another
           process's request, because it was trying to do an unrelated
           write. (When there isn't a third unrelated process involved, we get
           SIGRTMIN+2 and SIGRTMIN+4 respectively in these cases.)
       
           Thus, we use the following algorithm: if we know a reason why the
           file would be locked, we block on a signal, because we're going to
           get one; if we don't know a reason why the file would be locked, we
           alternate between attempting to set the lock, and checking to see who
           holds a conflicting lock and telling them to let go of it.

           All this time, to avoid race conditions, we keep the relevant signals
           masked. The functions here do not have to be async-signal-safe (a
