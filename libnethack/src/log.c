/*
 * The save file is too long, and the end needs to be removed. This happens in
 * six cases:
 *
 * - The save file was mostly in a correct format, but contains incomplete lines
 *   or some similar issue that prevents us reading the end of it;
 *
 * - The save file contains a partial turn from a version of the game engine
 *   that the process responsible for updating it doesn't know how to replay;
 *
 * - The save file contains a broken or buggy binary save;
 *
 * - A "this should never happen" situation actually has happened, and thus it's
 *   impossible or undesirable to go forwards in the game (forcing us to go back
 *   instead);
 *
 * - We need to undo the end-game sequence so that we can replay it to
 *   regenerate dumpfiles and xlog entries;
 *
 * - A wizard-mode user has explicitly said "this save file needs its end
 *   removing".
 *
 * The argument is an offset just past a newline (get_log_last_newline(),
 * get_log_start_of_turn_offset(), or program_state.end_of_gamestate_location).
 *
 * In almost every case, the user will be prompted to confirm the recovery, and
 * given a chance to decline it. If the recovery is declined, the game will be
 * terminated (ERR_RECOVER_REFUSED). If the recovery is accepted, it will be
 * performed, and then the engine will reload the game via RESTART_PLAY. If
 * "canreturn" is true, a third option will be given, "repair", which makes the
 * function return normally (and the caller is responsible for doing the actual
 * repair).
 *
 * The exception is when FM_RECOVERQUIT is in force ("message" NULL), which
 * means that an inconsistency has been detected between whether the server
 * thinks the game is over and whether the client thinks the game is over. In
 * such a case, we unconditionally recover to just before the death, then replay
 * the death, in order to regenerate things like dumpfiles and xlog entries. In
 * this case, this function returns normally, rather than via RESTART_PLAY.
 *
 * This function must not call panic(), because it is called /from/ panic().

 * * Whenever the target location moves to before the gamestate location
 *   (rewinding a replay, etc.).
 * * Whenever a section of the save file needs to be skipped due to desyncing.
 *
 * This also does something useful in the following situation:
 * * When the target location gets ahead of the gamestate location by more than
 *   a turn, calling log_sync() has the same effect as just running round the
 *   main loop in nh_play_game() would (assuming it syncs correctly), but is
 *   faster and less sensitive to engine changes.
 *
 * The gamestate location will not be moved to the target location itself if it
 * happens to be halfway through a turn; in this case, it will be moved to the
 * last save diff or save backup before the target location. (This happens even
 * if the previous gamestate location was between the target location and the
 * last save diff. In such a case, you may want to avoid using this function
 * altogether.)
 *
 * This should only be called from the nh_play_game main loop, or similar
 * locations that can handle arbitrary gamestate changes (including the
 * deallocation and reallocation of all game pointers). Exception: if
 * "inconsistent" is et, this function will not tamper with gamestate, but will
 * instead leave the log tracking in an inconsistent state (this is done when
 * computing locations for log_recover()). (If you want to use this function in
 * a situation where that is not true, use terminate(RESTART_PLAY), which causes
 * the main loop to restart, and modify nh_play_game to set the target location
 * you want rather than its default of TLU_EOF.) It also requires us to hold a
 * read lock on the log (i.e. log_init() needs to have been called, and it can't
 * be called from the section of nh_input_aborted() that temporarily
 * relinquishes the lock, not that you'd want to do that anyway).
 *
 * The invariants on the gamestate are suspended during this function, and fixed
 * at the end (unless inconsistent is set). In particular, while the function is
 * running, neither program_state.gamestate_location, or any elements of the
 * actual gamestate, have any meaning at all.
