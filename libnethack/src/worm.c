/*  Description of long worm implementation.
 *
 *  Each monst struct of the head of a tailed worm has a wormno set to
 *      1 <= wormno < MAX_NUM_WORMS
 *  If wormno == 0 this does not mean that the monster is not a worm,
 *  it just means that the monster does not have a long worm tail.
 *
 *  The actual segments of a worm are not full blown monst structs.
 *  They are small wseg structs, and their position in the levels.monsters[][]
 *  array is held by the monst struct of the head of the worm.  This makes
 *  things like probing and hit point bookkeeping much easier.
 *
 *  The segments of the long worms on a level are kept as an array of
 *  singly threaded linked lists.  The wormno variable is used as an index
 *  for these segment arrays.
 *
 *  wtails:     The first (starting struct) of a linked list.  This points
 *              to the tail (last) segment of the worm.
 *
 *  wheads:     The last (end) of a linked list of segments.  This points to
 *              the segment that is at the same position as the real monster
 *              (the head).  Note that the segment that wheads[wormno] points
 *              to, is not displayed.  It is simply there to keep track of
 *              where the head came from, so that worm movement and display are
 *              simplified later.
 *              Keeping the head segment of the worm at the end of the list
 *              of tail segments is an endless source of confusion, but it is
 *              necessary.
 *              From now on, we will use "start" and "end" to refer to the
 *              linked list and "head" and "tail" to refer to the worm.
 *
 *  One final worm array is:
 *
 *  wgrowtime:  This tells us when to add another segment to the worm.
 *
 *  When a worm is moved, we add a new segment at the head, and delete the
 *  segment at the tail (unless we want it to grow).  This new head segment is
 *  located in the same square as the actual head of the worm.  If we want
 *  to grow the worm, we don't delete the tail segment, and we give the worm
 *  extra hit points, which possibly go into its maximum.
 *
 *  Non-moving worms (worm_nomove) are assumed to be surrounded by their own
 *  tail, and, thus, shrink instead of grow (as their tails keep going while
 *  their heads are stopped short).  In this case, we delete the last tail
 *  segment, and remove hit points from the worm.
 * 
 *  (note: wheads, wtails and wgrowtime have been moved into struct level)
 */

/*
 *  get_wormno()
 *
 *  Find an unused worm tail slot and return the index.  A zero means that
 *  there are no slots available.  This means that the worm head can exist,
 *  it just cannot ever grow a tail.
 *
 *  It, also, means that there is an optimisation to made.  The [0] positions
 *  of the arrays are never used.  Meaning, we really *could* have one more
 *  tailed worm on the level, or use a smaller array (using wormno - 1).
 *
 *  Implementation is left to the interested hacker.
