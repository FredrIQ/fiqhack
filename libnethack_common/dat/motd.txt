# This file contains hints shown on start-up.  Unlike the rumours and oracles files, these do not contain spoilers: they should list only information that could plausibly be in the Guidebook.  This includes advice about controls (especially things that have changed since NetHack 3.4.3), about the very basics of gameplay (i.e. things we /want/ to be universally spoiled), and about the meta-game (contact emails, IRC channels, that sort of thing).  The MotDs are accessed directly from nethack4.org if possible (there's a network connection and the user is OK with using it); this allows notices like "there's a tournament on right now" or "a new version is available" to be added into the MotD stream.  This file is both used as the source for the nethack4.org MotDs when there's no such notice available, and perhaps someday as a fallback when there isn't a network connection.
#
# Each MotD is written as one very long line; the interface will wrap the text automatically.  Comment lines start with a #; any other line has a chance of appearing.  SO/SI (control-N/control-O, 0xE/0xF) can be used to mark text as typewriter font (typically rendered as bold in text-based ports); this is used to highlight controls ("press S to save the game"), URLs, and similar things.  Full stops that mark the end of a sentence are followed by two spaces.  MotDs that start with a + sign are much more likely to be shown; these are for major control changes or new player hints.
# This file is in no particular order (the order was originally chosen to minimise the chance of duplicate hints, and maximise the chance that everything was covered, via preserving the same order as things like the changelog).
#
+Normally, when you give your character a command, they will carry it out until it is complete or they get interrupted.  Use the numbers on the main keyboard to choose a different length of time for the command.  For instance, with default controls,  50. will wait for 50 turns, and 4e, will start eating an item on the ground, but stop after four turns even if your character hasn't finished eating.
When stepping onto a new square, your character will automatically pick up certain items.  Use the autopickup_rules option on the options menu to customise which items you want to be picked up.  Changing the value from the main menu will change it for all future games; changing it inside a game (with the O command, if you're using the default controls) will change it just for that game.
You can compare your NetHack skills with other players by checking your score at the end of the game.  You can see your score during a game, too; with default controls, press Control-X s.  Having a well-rounded character will get you more points than focusing on any specific area of gameplay; and although winning is the best way to get score, escaping from the dungeon even without the Amulet will give you a larger multiplier on your score than quitting, but even that is better than dying.
If you want the game to be more difficult, you can aim for some of the voluntary challenges ("conducts"); with default controls, press Control-X c in-game for a list.  These have no benefit to your score, but will appear in the dumplog at the end of your game.
If you wish to experiment with the game, you can play in "explore mode"; change the game mode with the mode option from outside the game.  This will give you unlimited life saving, unlimited enlightenment using (with default controls) Control-X w, and a free wand of wishing.  Games played in explore mode do not count in tournaments or for the high score table.
For players who want more of a challenge, you can play with characters who are permanently impaired; use the permablind option for a character who cannot see, or the permahallu option for a character who spends the entire game hallucinating.  These have no benefit to your score, but will appear in the dumplog at the end of the game.
Your character can assess the weight of items, to know what's burdening them; for example, "a food ration {20}" weighs 20 units (1 unit is the weight of 100 gold pieces).  You can see the total weight of your inventory, and how much weight your character can carry before they get slowed down, from the statistics menu (by default, on Control-X).
You can change the letters attached to items and spells, to use some more convenient letter.  Change the letters for items with the #adjust command, on Alt-a by default.  With the default controls, use + to change the letters for spells.
Normally, you attack by moving towards its square where you can see a monster.  If you want to attack a square where no monster is visible, or a friendly monster that your character would not normally want to attack, you can use the F command to force your character to attack.  Of course, punching a wall can be a bad idea.
By default, the time in a dungeon is based on UTC; this determines things like the time of day and the phase of the moon.  You can adjust the time in a dungeon to more closely match your own time via setting the timezone option outside a game.  (You cannot change the timezone of a dungeon after it is created.)
Is your character unable to read?  Do they need to read an artifact to complete the game?  No problem, just invoke it instead (by default, with the V command), and it'll perform its usual actions.
Normally, your character can examine their surroundings without spending time; with the default controls, press : to get a reminder of what is on your square.  When blind, you will have to feel around instead; use s to search the walls around you, or Control-G to search the ground beneath your feet.
+Your character normally can only manipulate items in their inventory.  In some cases, you can use an item on the floor; in this case, use , as the item letter.  For instance, you eat from the floor with e,, open containers on the floor with a,, and drink from a fountain on the floor with q,.
+When you tell your character to do something time-consuming, they will stop if something interrupts them, like a monster coming into view.  If you want to tell them to continue, with default controls, press Control-A to continue or repeat the last action.  For example, if you tell your character to wait for 50 turns with 50. and they get hungry after 20, pressing Control-A will continue waiting for another 30 turns.
+When you want to keep track of an item, monster, or dungeon level, you can give it a name to remind yourself of what it is using (with default controls) the C command.  For an item, you can track a single item (Cy), or all items of one type (Cn); and you can name a type of item even without having one handy using CA (if you know what it looks like) or CV (if you saw one get destroyed recently).
+The word "Elbereth", which scares monsters, can be very valuable in keeping your character alive; to tell them to quickly scrawl it in the dust beneath their feet, with default controls, press Control-E.  Some players may prefer to play without the use of this word, in order to add more challenge to the game; the game will track how many times you use it in the dumplog, and you can turn its special powers on or off for future games using the elbereth option.
To move long distances without having to repeatedly press keys, you can use the travel command (on _ by default) to move to a particular square, or use a g or Numpad 5 prefix or (with the letter keys and default controls) hold Control to keep moving in a given direction (or Shift for a more reckless version of the same behaviour).  The behaviour of this can be fine-tuned using the corridorbranch option.
+To open a door, you can normally just walk into it.  If you need to close, open, or unlock a door in other circumstances, with default controls, use the o command.  If a door is locked, you will have to pick the lock; your character will use the unlocking tool they most recently used, or else can specify one explicitly using (with default controls) a.  Alternatively, you can kick the door down; with default controls, this is Control-D.
+If you can't remember all the commands for manipulating objects, don't worry; open your inventory with i, then select an item, and you'll get a list of everything you can do with it.
Your character may be reluctant to enter water or lava; without magical aid, they can't swim, and definitely can't survive that much heat for long.  If you know that they'll be safe, or need them to enter the water or lava anyway, you can confirm the action byprefixing the movement command with the m key(with default controls).
+Your character will memorise what they see of the dungeon as they explore.  At any time, you can ask them what they remember of the dungeon with the Control-O command; (with default key bindings) and you can select a level from this list to view the character's memory of that individual level.  Of course, it may have changed since the character last saw what was there.
+All actions you make in the game are saved immediately; you cannot revert back to an old save, and if your character dies (and cannot be resurrected), that's it for the game, and you must start a new one.  Due to continuous saving, you can safely close the game any time (by closing the window, or using Control-C).  You can also use S then ! to quit the game and delete the save file; if you do this, you will not be able to resume that game in the future.
+If you get bored of micromanaging your character's exploration, you can ask them to take over for a while by pressing (with default controls) v; they will explore until they find something interesting or get interrupted by a monster or similar danger.  As always, you can continue the exploration after such an interruption using Control-A, or simply pressing v again.  However, a skilled player will probably get better results by exploring manually.
Some characters can fight using two weapons at once.  With default controls, ready the secondary weapon using x or A, wield the primary weapon with w, then press X.  The pushweapon option implicitly uses x every time you wield an item, so if using that option, wield the secondary weapon rather than readying it.
+To use ranged weapons that need ammunition, such as bows, wield the bow with w and throw the arrow with t.  If you are holding an appropriate launcher, you will use the launcher to do the "throwing", hitting enemies much harder than merely throwing an arrow at them by hand.  As a shortcut, you can place ammunition in your quiver using Q or A; then you can throw it with the f command, which is identical to t except that it uses items from your quiver rather than asking which item to throw.
Interested in what has happened to your character over the course of the game?  You can view a history of your game using the #history command, or in the dumplog.
Although most players will use the  default controls, you can place almost any command on almost any key: use the keymap option from the options menu.  For instance, this may be useful for players with a German keyboard, who may want to swap y and z so that the movement keys stay together on the keyboard.  If there is something wrong with your key bindings, you can reset them to default from this menu.
+If you set options from the main menu, they will apply to all future games until you change them back; this means you do not have to edit the options files by hand.  This will have no effect on games that have already started.  If you change an option using the O command inside a game, this will change it just for that game, and will persist even if you close NetHack and later reload the game.
Sometimes you might stumble across a "bones level", containing the corpse of another character after their demise, complete with their items, and whatever it is that killed them.  These levels can be unexpectedly hard, or unexpectedly rewarding; thus, some people disallow them for serious competitions or tournament play, because they add too much randomness to make it easy to compare games.  If you want to avoid getting a bones level in future games you start, set the bones option to false from the main menu.
If you want more information while playing, try sizing your terminal larger.  The more room there is to display facts about the game, the more facts can be displayed.  If you're stuck with a small terminal (perhaps because you have a small screen), you can still get at the information using commands like (with default key bindings) Control-X for information about your character, i to view inventory, and : for information on your current square.  More room also means that more messages can be displayed without needing a --More-- prompt.
+If you find a bug in NetHack 4, or want to request a feature, please report it: <http://trac.nethack4.org>.  Your feedback helps to shape the future of the game.
+For more information about NetHack 4, visit our website: <http://nethack4.org>.
+You can contact the NetHack 4 developers, or other players, via IRC.  See <irc://irc.freenode.net/nethack> for gameplay advice, or <irc://irc.freenode.net/nethack4> for development discussion (and advice on NetHack 4 specifically rather than NetHack in general).
Some monsters are not hostile, and may even fight on your side.  You start the game with a pet cat, dog, or pony; your pet, and any other allies you meet, will be marked with an icon (when using graphical tiles) or a blue background (for character-based play).  Monsters that are not hostile towards you, but that would prefer to mind their own business rather than adventuring with you, are shown with an icon or a brown background.
When playing with graphical tiles, you can see stairways, and other terrain features, even beneath monsters and items.  A character-based interface cannot display two characters on a square directly, so in character-based play, stairway tiles have a red background.
When your character discovers a trap, they will remember its location.  In graphical tiles play, the trap will be visible behind any item or monster on the square.  In character-based play, the tile would not be visible, so trap tiles have a cyan background in order that you always remain aware of the trap's location.
When you have enough practice with a weapon, spell, or other action, and you have enough experience exploring the dungeon, you may be able to improve your skill with that action using the #enhance command.  Different characters will have different prospects for improving their skills; for instance, a wizard would have the most potential in their magical abilities, whereas a monk would rather let their fists do the talking.
+There are two ways to give commands to change equipment.  Beginners will find it easiest to use the equipment screen (on A by default), that lets them choose equipment slots and place items in them; even advanced players may find this useful if they want to do something unusual, like changing their readied weapon without letting go of the weapon they are wielding.  Most experienced players prefer to use commands specific to one action, such as (by default) w to change their wielded weapon, and W and T to put on and remove jewellery and armor; these do the same thing as A but are faster to type.
+Your character can move both orthogonally and diagonally, in 8 compass directions.  By default, there are three ways to give movement commands.  If you are using the arrow keys to move, you can move diagonally with Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn. You can also move with the numeric keypad (with some terminals, you will need to turn off NumLock for this to work).  On some keyboards, these methods are difficult to use; and on any keyboard, using only the main keyboard allows less hand movement.  Thus, many players will prefer to move using the main keyboard with h, j, k, l, y, u, b, n.  Of course, you can use the keymap option to set up your own choice of keys for movement.
The movement commands are used for movement, but also opening doors and interacting with monsters.  By default, they will open doors, attack hostile monsters, either chat to peaceful monsters or ask for confirmation to attack, and swap places with your allies.  For some sorts of play, these defaults are inappropriate; for instance, pacifist players rarely want to attack enemies.  Thus, you can change them with the movecommand option.
Some players like more detail in their view of the map; others prefer a less busy display with fewer colors.  If you want to change how much detail is shown, try changing the draw_ options in the options menu.
To sell items in a shop, drop them in the shop's interior; if the shopkeeper is interested in buying the item, they'll quote you a price.  You can pick up items owned by the shop without buying them, but be careful; shopkeepers do not appreciate damage to their items.  To buy shop-owned items in your inventory, press p (with the default key bindings), or walk into the shopkeeper.
+When your character is injured, their wounds will heal over time.  This happens whether they are moving or not, but if you feel it would be safer to avoid exploring deeper while injured, you can get them to spend their time resting (with default key bindings, .), but perhaps a better use of their time would be searching their surroundings for traps and other hidden thing (s).  Resting for just one turn, the default, is not long enough to heal most wounds; you can rest or search for longer with a repeat count, as in 99. (using the main keyboard numbers).
Characters can attempt to learn magic spells by reading an appropriate spellbook with r (with default key bindings), although unintelligent character would be unwise to try.  After learning a spell, it can be cast with Z (again assuming default key bindings).  Spells require magical power (Pw) to cast, which regenerates over time.  The spellbook is not needed to cast a spell, but very occasionally, will need to be studied again to refresh a character's memory of the spell.
The most common use for a wand is to zap it to release its magic; with default controls, this is the z command. However, your character can also write with it using E, or even break it using V if they are really desperate.
Wearing armor is the simplest way to increase your character's Defence value, making you harder to hit or reducing the damage you take.  Enchanted armor will have more of an effect (or be less effective, with a negative enchantment).  Cursed armor is normally harmful, in addition to being impossible to remove.  There are also other magical ways in which one's defences might be improved.
+Your character needs to eat to survive, but some food is more dangerous than others.  The corpses of monsters are one source of food, but should be eaten immediately after they die, if at all, to ensure they are fresh; and some corpses are poisonous or otherwise harmful despite this.  Food poisoning from excessively old food can be fatal.  Food rations provide a less dangerous source of food, but may not be numerous enough for your character to survive.
+If you're in trouble, slow down!  Time does not pass in the dungeon unless you are giving your character commands; at any point, you can just step back from the keyboard and nothing will happen.  Some informational commands, such as : (to review the ground at your feet) or Control-X (to view information about your character) in the default set of key bindings, also take no time when used.
+Many magical items are of an unknown nature, and will change from game to game.  However, scrolls, potions, wands, rings and amulets of the same magical nature will look the same; while an "orange potion" might work differently from one game to the next, two orange potions found in the same game will be very similar (if not identical) in the way they behave.  When your character figures out what an item is, they will memorise the information, and you will then see, for instance, a "potion of sleeping" rather than an "orange potion".  With the default key bindings, you can press the \ key to see a list of known items and their descriptions; and you can use the Cn or CA commands to tell your character the identity of an item, if you work it out before they do.
+In dire emergencies, your character can pray to the gods for help using #pray.  It is unwise to bother a deity too often - even if they agree with your actions, they do not like to be relied upon - but sometimes, hoping for divine intervention is your character's best hope of survival.  If you wish to honour the gods, using #sacrifice (which can also be written #offer) allows you to sacrifice a corpse on an altar.
Containers such as bags and chests can be opened using the a command (with default key bindings). This works even if they are on the ground: press , when asked for an item.  Some containers may be locked; you need to place them on the ground to be able to unlock them.  You can try to pick the lock with an appropriate tool (a on the unlocking by default), or bust it open by kicking it or forcing a weapon into the lock (with default key bindings, Control-D and #force respectively).
+Your character's purpose in the dungeon is to collect the Amulet of Yendor, which is somewhere deep in the dungeon's depths.  Leaving the dungeon without the Amulet is possible, but will end your game, and is only useful for the slight score bonus that comes from surviving.  Most characters, though, will be struggling to survive at the start of the game, and should focus on learning and training to survive in a dungeon well before they even consider aiming for the Amulet.
You can view replays of completed games from the main menu.  To move around in a replay, use the direction keys; the orthogonal keys move one turn, and the diagonals further distances.
+Generally applicable commands, such as saving/closing the game or viewing an instant replay, can be accessed from the main menu; with default controls, press ! when entering commands or Control-C any time.  You could also just use S to save or quit the game, but unlike going through the menu, it does not work while a prompt is onscreen.
