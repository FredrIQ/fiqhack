#ifndef MESSAGECHANNEL_H
# define MESSAGECHANNEL_H

/* "Message channel" definitions. Each message is assigned to a channel, which
   basically unifies messages that the UI might want to treat the same way.
   This allows for a MSGTYPE equivalent with considerably less configuration
   required.

   The order of the definitions is not 100% arbitrary: it groups together
   messages from a similar source, and orders the sources, and messages within
   each source, by importance (from most to least). However, it will necessarily
   be somewhat subjective, so relying on the order for anything but presenting
   lists to the user may be unwise.

   When adding entries to this, also add default rules to them in messages.c.

   Warning: this file is currently included from nethack_types.h (because it
   contains the definition of windowprocs), and thus should do nothing but
   define the one enum it's supposed to define. */

 * Channels that need special handling:
 * - msgc_emergency should be converted to a raw_print
 * - msgc_impossible causes an impossible(); the distinction from
 *   msgc_emergency is that it's an in-game message, just one that shouldn't
 *   appear in this context; and it's used much like msgc_mute in order to
 *   pass to a function that shouldn't be producing messages; just impossible()
 *   instead if it's convenient to do so.
 * - msgc_noidea should come with instructions to contact the developers (in
 *   beta versions, it outright puts up a dialog box; in release versions it
 *   puts an entry in the paniclog)
 * - msgc_debug is hidden by pline() outside debug mode
 * - msgc_alignchaos is converted to msgc_alignbad for lawful players
 *   (otherwise it's left as-is and will probably be given a neutral color)
 * - msgc_mispaste can lock the program if a high density is seen
 * - msgc_reminder has special --More-- handling (i.e. it doesn't)
 * - msgc_controlhelp, msgc_actionboring, msgc_trapescape are used for things
 *   that are suppressed by flags.verbose in 3.4.3
 * - msgc_offlevel messages are simply discarded in pline(), with an
 *   impossible() for the time being because we don't have multiplayer code yet
 * - msgc_mute messages are discarded in pline() full stop (this case is used
 *   for functions that conditionally produce messages; we code it as
 *   unconditionally producing the message and conditionalizing the channel)
