/* Command parameters.
 *
 * A command description specifies a set of parameters that it understands. All
 * the parameters are optional. Because the client does not usually have enough
 * information to explain to the user what an argument means, it should normally
 * omit arguments, in which case the engine will prompt for them if necessary.
 *
 * There are some exceptions to this:
 *
 * * CMD_ARG_LIMIT is never prompted for by the engine (omitting it means "no
 *   limit"); a client should send it if the user specified a limit on the
 *   command (say, using main keyboard numbers in a vikeys-based interface), and
 *   not otherwise. If a command does not have a CMD_ARG_LIMIT tag, a client
 *   should typically interpret what would be a limit as command repeat instead.
 *   (A limit is an integer that specifies some number which should not be
 *   exceeded when running the command, e.g. the maximum number of 
 *
 * * CMD_ARG_OBJ should normally be omitted, but in clients that use a
 *   menu-based interface in combination with get_obj_commands(), they have
 *   enough information to tell the user what the argument means.
 *
 * * CMD_MOVE, movement commands, should always be given a direction.
 *
 * * Some interfaces for other roguelikes work via having an ability to specify
 *   a default direction, which is used for all commands. At the time of writing
 *   there are no NetHack interfaces which work on this principle, but if any
 *   are written, they should feel free to specify CMD_ARG_DIR in every response
 *   where it makes sense. A client should /never/ prompt the user for a
 *   direction except in response to a getpos() call or if CMD_MOVE is set;
 *   CMD_ARG_DIR is sometimes specified on commands (like zap) where a direction
 *   is sometimes relevant but sometimes irrelevant. Thus, it should only be
 *   sent if the server has asked for it, repeating a command when the server
 *   asked for it on a previous repeat, or as a result of an interface like the
 *   one described above.
