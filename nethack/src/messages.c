/* The message display works via using the concept of "chunks".  A chunk is one
   line high, and can potentially be as wide as the message buffer (but can be
   narrower); a longer message is broken into multiple chunks. At any given
   point, either all the messages, or all but one, are converted into chunk
   form; the last is kept around until we request a key, then chunked depending
   on whether the keypress is for a --More-- (i.e. we need to leave space) or
   for some other reason.

   Chunks conceptually form a coordinate system that scrolls vertically forever
   (positive x to the right, with 0 being the leftmost column, positive y going
   downwards, with arbitrary zero). However, once a chunk scrolls too far off
   the top of the screen (a distance of settings.msghistory), we deallocate
   it. The chunks are stored in a doubly linked list, sorted by increasing y and
   then by increasing x; we keep pointers to the first and last chunk in sort
   order.

   The chunks don't have to be seen in contiguous order (and often won't be due
   to reminder chunks and spacing chunks). However, we only try to keep unseen
   chunks visible to the user while they're actually on the screen; if one
   escapes the screen while it's unseen (say due to the window being resized),
   its unseen status is ignored unless it somehow gets back onto the screen
   again. This case should hardly ever come up (and we can assume that a user
   who's resizing the screen looked at the messages on it before the resize, so
   it doesn't harm anything). */

             message in; splitting it would occupy the last line with the first
             part, and thus there'd be nowhere else to put the rest;

           - If we have one spare line and no entire_last_line requirement, then
             we can just put the first part of the split onto that spare line;

           - If we have no spare lines, then the message will have to share a
             line, and thus can't also split.

           We calculate how much of the line is usable in the cases that we
           share, split, or do neither. (If we split, and we're using the last
           line for the first half, we'll definitely need room for a
