! This text tileset lists tiles that look different in Unicode and in

! Please restrict these to Unicode characters that exist on Windows
! Glyph List 4. (Windows is the worst out of the major operating
! systems at rendering fonts.) They should also have an exact or close
! approximation on code page 437.

! Note: When overriding something to Unicode here, you probably want
! to override it back to ASCII in rogue_overrides.txt.

! Unicodey terrain.
