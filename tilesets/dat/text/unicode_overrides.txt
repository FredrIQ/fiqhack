! This text tileset lists tiles that look different in Unicode and in

! Please restrict these to Unicode characters that exist on Windows
! Glyph List 4. (Windows is the worst out of the major operating

! Note: When overriding something to Unicode here, you probably want
! to override it back to ASCII in rogue_overrides.txt.
